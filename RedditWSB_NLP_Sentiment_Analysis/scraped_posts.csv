Reposting to WSB because, well honestly, you give better feedback than GME sub.

I am new to investing, but I am trying to determine my own ""fair market value"" for one share of GME, assuming after the squeeze gets squoze, and **after** all the short-interest and dust settles, where would a company, such as GameStop, likely trade at based on a mildly optimistic **future outlook** (3-5 years)?

Just remember the vision that R.C. has discussed in writings to GameStop, and the future strategic goals he hopes to achieve.

&#x200B;

I think the safest **industry(s)** we can assume, given the ""digital-first"" strategy would be:

\- E-Commerce (Online Retail) 125b, PE 129.05, Exp growth **20.17%**

\- Retail (Distributor) 27b PE 21.91, Exp growth **10%**

\- Software (Entertainment), 44b,  PE 109.44, Exp growth **19.72%**

\- Gaming Industry 47b, PE  27, Exp growth **12%**

&#x200B;

**Similar Industry/Potential Competition:**

Best Buy (28.6B / 16 PE),

Target (89.5B / 21 PE),

Amazon (1.54T / 74 PE),

Netflix (226B / 85 PE),

Steam/Valve (62.46B),

Overstock(?), Walmart(?)

&#x200B;

**Pros**

\+ E-commerce retail, expanding reach in current markets (US/CA/AUS/EU)

\+ Consolidate physical stores, Free Up Cash for next cycle.

\+ In-Store Entertainment (VR / Lan / Tournament hosting etc)

\+ Multi-Channel Distribution (Gaming PCs, Video Games, Streaming (P))

\+ Brand Awareness / Expanded (free!) publicity

\+ 60m+ Power-Up Reward subscription service

\+ Same-day delivery of Video Games/PC Hardware from existing locations ^((credit both)

[^(SomeGuyNamedPaul)](https://www.reddit.com/user/SomeGuyNamedPaul/) ^(/) [^(Iam\_nameless)](https://www.reddit.com/user/Iam_nameless/) ^(from previous post))

\+ (Possible) Streaming Service

\+ (Possible) In-Store Entertainment, Kids and Adults

\+ (Possible) P2P Marketplace??

\+ (Possible) Capture microtransaction market

\+ (Possible) Esports brand/ Streaming

\+ (Possible) Ad revenue on their streaming service etc. (\~30B gaming ad rev)

\+ (Possible) On-Demand Gaming platform

&#x200B;

**Cons**

\- Past performance

\- Lower demand for physical games (\~15-17%)

\-  About 80% of total Video Games revenue (200B) came from F2P Microtransactions in 2018

&#x200B;

What's the worst that can happen right?

I just want to know what a share of GME should be worth, using a future-looking fundamental approach to an evolving/pivoting business, and what the ""generally expected"" price would be if everything goes ""according to plan"" (given 80-90% success probably, for instance).

&#x200B;

**Anything you guys wanna add/remove** let me know, I will soon add some Industry data and revenue projections as soon as I research and write it all down..

# Thanks to everyone providing their feedback so far.

# Looks like my next steps are to dig into competitor businesses for profit margin data, determine the financial impact the initial pivot strategies.

# The March 23 Earnings Call should hopefully provide an overview of the business strategy moving forward, and I should have more related financial/sector data ready at that time.

DD,Open GME Calls & Puts 03/19,208,m6qizs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6qizs/open_gme_calls_puts_0319/,63,1615978669.0,"I just had a look at the option chains of GME 03/19.

At 300$ there will be 11,619 Puts ITM and 77,465 Calls ITM.

At 200$ there are 19,620 Puts ITM and 54,045 Calls ITM.

At 150$ there will be 50,619 Puts ITM and 43,915 Calls ITM.

(this data ca be found on the NASDAQ option chain website, so feel free to check for yourself).

&#x200B;

**So what does this mean for friday 03/19?**

Every GME stock price above 300 $ will become a glorious tendies day and might start the rocket to valhalla from friday on.

Every GME Stock price above 200$ will still be really painful for the shorters. So I guess that is the hedgies main goal until friday: to drill to the stock by any means lower than 200$.

Every GME Stock price below 150 $ on 03/19 will end in... well... So many PUTS then in the money, this will end really bad for the stock price and shorters will make a lot of money to reload their shorting ammo.

&#x200B;

**\*\*TLDR:\*\***

GME above 300 $ on friday: Start to Valhalla from friday on.

GME above \~170$ on friday, Calls will still win, GME will rise more.

Anything below 150$ on friday: Here we go again, 40$ GME.

So it's very important this week that we and the long wales are able to keep the stock price >170$.

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

Regarding Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls:

The huge amounts of new 800c Calls last week didn't help us because it was way out of the money for the Marketmakers, so they didn't see a reason to cover those calls. Stock price was \~260 USD last week, and 800$ was \~3x the stock price. When a strike price of 3x the stock price is so high for the MM that they don't cover their calls, THEN why should they cover those 200$+ calls when the stock price was 40$ three weeks ago. At 40$ Stock price a call of 200$ would have been 5x the stock price back then, and therefore WAY out of the money. So I really think there are a lot of naked calls expiring this Friday, so shit will hit the fan for the shorters when they become exercised.   
If there's some Pro here who can clarify the MMs covering process I'd be grateful.",2021-03-17 06:57:49

GameStop’s last fiscal year ended February 1, 2020, in which they reported almost $200 million in cash flow on over $5 Billion in revenue.  That’s after a hard year but let’s take it as a baseline. A growth *tech* company with working capital and an aggressive business plan - you can easily conceive rapid bottom line growth. Let’s presume GameStop nets $1 Billion in profit by the end of this year. After applying a price multiple of 19 (pretty modest) then GME is fairly valued at - wait for it - exactly where it is now, with a $19 Billion market cap. Anyone with a Long-Term Price Target of less than where it closed today, is staying blind on purpose.

Any stock ownership over 100% indicates that the stock is being shorted heavily. That is because fake shares were somewhat created and sold by a short seller to another buyer. Now both the original owner and the new buyer of the stock can claim ownership of the same shares, which effectively doubled the amount of shares being held.

For example, I buy 1 GME share. Melvin Capital borrows my one share to short sell and sells it to my friend Bob. Now both Bob and I can claim that we each own one share when in fact one of those shares is fake.

If I remember correctly the current institutional ownership of GME is 118% and the estimated retail ownership sits around 30%+. This means lots of fake shares exist.

All of this being said, I have no idea what this means for anyone who is holding a fake share if the short position closes. In theory for the overall ownership of the stock to drop below 100% and become a realistic number again, shorts have to cover and return their borrowed shares. There have been plenty of failures to deliver lately but no one seems to be doing anything about it.

My guess is that while short sellers have not increased their positions, that have been diamond handing their short shares, going as far as borrowing money to continue paying the hefty interest rates (a brokerage likely would not margin call a short seller to buy back the position if they can keep coming up with interest money). At this point it seems as if the only way for this to be over is if one side folds and closes its position. Whether the short sellers fold and buy their shorts first or the retail investors sell their shares is to be seen.

TLDR: I’m just a retard. GME 🚀🚀🚀 this is not financial advice

Edit: some mentioned that holders don’t pay interest which is true. As long as the interest to short GME remains high, those who hold should benefit in theory.

Edit: I should clarify because some are getting worked up over it but I’m not saying that if you own a “fake” share that you’re just screwed over when this is over. You still hold claim to ownership. When the short squeeze happens, the only way for shorts to close their positions will be to reclaim and buy back the shares that they sold short, which effectively reduces the on-paper ownership of GME bringing it back down to 100% as no one is claiming ownership of the same shares. The only thing that will bring this back to just 100% is if shareholders decide to sell back to a short seller.",2021-03-17 06:20:06

First and for most we would like to thank you for the wonderful dips. I am sure it was quite painful to watch each dip go up rather than down in your favor. Must be tough shorting a stock only to know now more have bought it and to cover is just going to take longer.

Have you not learned? Honestly, even a retard can tell when you have nowhere to go. You are completely trapped in your own cycle of shorting the stock and hoping it has a sell off. Literally it is like a nightmare you cannot escape.

Think about it, all you had to do was buy to cover. Seriously, it wasn't difficult the first time but you just had to make sure that the little lose right?

The little guys have been losing all their life, while you're used to seeing greens in your portfolio and thinking to yourself about how stupid the retards are for getting into a fair ""stock"" market and that anyone can become rich.

I'm not trying to make you mad, I just think you are at this point; fighting a losing battle. I do however, sympathize with you. Only a little bit. You just haven't seen the amount of depression in your life yet to know that it is actually normal to actually lose money. In a fair market, that's how it should have been in the first place.

The thing is you should have covered when we said GME to $1000, honestly, this could have been the best decision of you life. You were losing peanuts to what you could have made back in 5 years or less with all that great manipulation. You were changing a few percentage of peoples lives for the better. It that couldn't make you feel better about losing money, then nothing will.

But seriously, instead you tried and mess with the massive amount of retardation that I haven't seen in years. You really don't know how millennials yet think do you?

Hint: WE DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING

No matter how long it takes, you bet that no one is selling at a $1000 at this point. I don't think anyone will ever sell for the price you are going to offer.

**Next my fellow retards,**

HDOL! Nothing more left to say. Keep buying dips and wait. Just wait. It will happen. EVENTUALLY.

No time limit needed on how long it takes. We hold forever 🙌🙌🙌

Remember, if you are ever confused about anyone selling and leaving you behind, we are not. We are all in this together and we will come back for any retard that bought at $420.69 and beyond.

My blind senses are tingling. This is going to be one epic year.

I can't wait to go to GameStop and let them take my games for $3 dollars and me being perfectly happy by getting screwed by them. Because GME is my baby and you never try to take our baby away from us.

TO THE MOON. AND BEYOND. WHEREVER WE GO. GAMESTOP WILL BE THERE.

So I listened to you monkes and bought RKT.
Then I listened again and bought some UWMC.

Now UWMC is sitting low right now, and expectations are plain that it’ll recover with magnificent green for anyone HODLing like a good boy. And UWMC is coming out of the RKT little trade dispute claiming victory. And their graph looks promising, since the expectation is it’ll go back up, then keep growing because why wouldn’t it? Unless their ultimatum doesn’t pan out how they hoped it would?

But RKT isn’t just going to go out of business. Their stock price is lowish, and maybe they lost some market share to UWMC after that ultimatum. But odds are they’ll recover; or at least won’t go broke immediately. They don’t announce their next earnings until May, so we won’t know for sure how this pans out for a little while. But here’s the thing. As of a week ago, with the previous earnings report, RKT has an EPS higher than the price. That gives it a P/E of <1 as of writing. And that means it *should* go up.

Look at any other stock. Their P/E, specifically. You’ll see 10, 20, 50. Bought TSLA? That’s 1000x P/E. That means that the stock price is that many *times* higher than that percentage of the company is profitable. Higher P/E values are irrational, and represent investors expecting the company to grow to meet that number. Except for insane stocks like TSLA, because growing that much is impossible. But big numbers are fun, and TSLA attracts the nuts, so fine. TSLA is a rollercoaster. Just, perhaps, a rickety one.

Now look at UWMC. Their P/E is 0, because their EPS is negative. They are losing money, they are unprofitable. This is not a good thing for a company to be. Without outside assistance or major internal change, they’ll run out of money eventually and go out of business. Unless they’re a growth stock in a new company, in which case those negative earnings represent the “start up time”; getting the ball rolling costs; once it gets going, it pays off. And guess what, UWMC *is* growing, so hey there might be something to that.

But RKT? They are objectively undervalued. And while the stock market is generally understood to be irrational, it will, occasionally, pass through the rational values to get to other irrational values. Moreover, it’s generally irrational *up*, not *down*.

Point is, UWMC should go up because it’s a growing company, and may *hopefully soon* become profitable.

Meanwhile, RKT should also go up, because it is *actually* profitable *and* undervalued right now.

So *why not both*?

Elliot Wave Theory

Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below...

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.

As you can see, our fellow 🦍 Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"".Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7zcxlzn7ohn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7d5d431d351b8011ef4a5b4fa4fb123b4ee064

Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bf1arfybohn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7503b533893b2ab4b05ddc4ac04df20675939cf

Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mindblowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. 🤯 I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

So you are telling me that fellow 🦍 Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first 🚀 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ktfxk4aeohn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaadea58e519cfb08c76a483298b9d56e83ad4bb

Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January 

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our 🚀 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3iokow4gohn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=d721faa86a85d269ba2f45abd2ac9194b467f6ec

What actually happened after that ""prediction""?

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our 🚀 take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

&#x200B;

🚀 Pre-Launch

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few 📄 🙌 bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impuls that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our 🚀 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the 🚀 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**",2021-03-17 05:16:16

Zomedica is an animal health company focused on meeting the needs of clinical veterinarians in ways that promote both patient and practice health. Our mission is to advance the effectiveness and financial well-being of veterinary practitioners by delivering professionally beneficial diagnostic products and services.

*Disclaimer: I´m not even close to being a financial advisor so please do your research and make your own decisions based on what you understand.*

*I´m a noob so please* *don´t defenestrate this* *I would very much like to hear your opinions about the stock.*

**TRUFORMA main product and homerun winner:**

Truforma is a point-of-care device meant to deliver testing for thyroid and adrenal disease. Truforma uses ""Bulk Acoustic Wave"" (BAW) technology which they claim provides accurate and repeatable test results. It offers complete control over the testing process from start to finish, with highly sensitive and specific immunoassays that allow veterinarians to make clinical decisions faster.

The immunoassays deliver accurate, reliable data when testing for thyroid and adrenal disease. Assay performance metrics to determine specificity and sensitivity were determined with the goal of meeting or exceeding the stringent testing standards found in a reference lab setting.  

The process on how to use it is simple:

1) Obtain a Sample

2) Add the Sample to the Cartridge

3) Insert the Cartridge into Truforma

4) Results will be provided in 20 minutes or less on average.

**Zomedica Announces First Commercial Sale of Its Truforma® Platform:**

The first official purchaser of a TRUFORMA® system was Jason Berg, DVM, DACVIM, founder and president of Guardian Veterinary Specialists, a 29,000-square-foot advanced emergency critical care and specialty hospital in Brewster, New York.

Dr. Berg commented that “As a veterinary internist and business owner, I have devoted myself to advancing the practice of veterinary internal medicine and delivering care with a difference – doing more, providing more, and caring more. I am excited to be the first veterinarian to purchase TRUFORMA®. I will be able to go above and beyond the current standard of care to provide cutting-edge and novel testing to pet owners and veterinarians in seven surrounding counties across two states.

[*https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zomedica-announces-first-commercial-sale-100000980.html*](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zomedica-announces-first-commercial-sale-100000980.html)

**My opinion on this:**

Potential competitors include large veterinary diagnosis companies, small businesses focused on animal health, reference laboratory services provided by academic institutions, and in-clinic products providers. Some of these are Idexx Laboratories Inc., Antech Diagnostics, Abaxis Inc., just to name a few. These are way bigger and although they don’t have something like Truforma, they have the assets to compete and maybe win. 

Having said this, I predict two outcomes, one is that the company will have a nice growth in the short term, with nice profit potential but not a good long term. If this gets bought by one of its competitors, then we can see a massive price increase on the stock. Why do I think this can get bought? It´s cheaper for the competition to buy than to develop. Idexx currently has over a 43B market cap.

Also, if the first buyer bought one unit for a 29,000-square-foot, then I don´t know how many units might be sold.

I´m betting on this for the short term, with this cutting-edge technology, my price target is at 4.6, about a 100% upside.

Here’s my update after today’s fuckery. 

Real quick disclaimer. I get hype in my posts because that’s what I provide; excitement, facts, and encouragement. I’m doing this because sometimes we need to vent together and re-evaluate the game plan. I get up at 4am every morning, pop an addy and hope for the best/expect the worst. This is why I’m hype, take it or leave it. I also don’t have a job right now. I used to sell mortgages and made a lot of money so now I fucking work my ass off to learn everyday and make a living day trading. Not financial advice.

First, let me discuss the elephant in the room. We were so fucking close. RKT was pushing and flagging and ready too moon after its third attempt above 27. That’s the most frustrating part. There was no volume after that so I repositioned lower when I saw the whole market tanking, not just RKT. Here we go again...The VIX (volatility index) has been below 20 this week and bears have raped meme stocks taking advantage of this. I’m sitting there getting pissed off because it’s like every boomer out there needs to suck J. Powell’s D Thursday before deciding if they like a stock or not. They bow down until hedgies decide what they want to do....pussies. Fuck em. The opportunity was there and some wales got in today for sure, but not enough. WSB also didn’t help much because a majority of you think RKT is a distraction from GME. If we just broke 27 we were going to rocket this stock to Mars. I was getting mad at my fellow apes because I imagined you guys sitting there with your dick in your hands waiting for your stimi to come in, and knowing that most of you didn’t know how close we were. It was right there. Then I saw something.

The whole market tanked AS SOON AS GME WENT GREEN. It’s comical honestly. Gme is basically a new index. It’s like citadel called in friends to sell their positions before we mooned it. 

Here’s my take on RKT and GME for the rest of the week. It all depends on the markets reaction to j Powell. The bond and inflation worries have been hurting tech stocks and RKT. My guess is that he will say the same shit as last time...we’re not raising rates. Ok well does the market tank more? I don’t think so. I think will see a sharp decline prior to j Powell then a recovery. That’s my hope. Today’s sell off lacked volume. It was artificial IMO. Hold on to your horses, it could get bloody, but there is always sunshine at the end of the tunnel unless the companies go bankrupt which they won’t. 

If RKT can bounce back above 26 then we’re right back in the game. Again, there really weren’t many sells until panic overcame the paper hands. Just need wales to get their j Powell fix first and stimis should be clearing banks tomorrow too. If the market is slow and not moving then bears have more power. We need to help make it move. 

If the market is slow I would by some calls for longer expirations while they are cheap. That’s the great part of downward volatility - cheap calls. 

Let’s finish the week off positively. We’re in this together. Not financial advice I just like the stock and it’s undervalued as shit.",2021-03-17 04:41:04

I know I may get banned or laughed at, and this doesn't exactly follow the rules (sorry) but it needs to be said. I have one share of GME that I bought at ~$40 a few weeks ago. I have around 200 shares in amc with about 15 options as well. The thing I don't get is all fo the hate between the two. People saying GME is dead. Or AMC is a distraction. If you truly do your DD you would see neither is dead and neither is a distraction. 

AMC is better because it has a cheaper buy in. GME is better because it has a higher target for share price. But none of that matters. Either one of these is sending a message. It's giving the middle finger for 2008. It's calling out the manipulation. It's saying enough is enough. 

Hating each other causes AMC AND GME to lose. Not one single ""retail investor"" should be hoping the other fails. Because if either AMC or GME wins, the hedgies hurt. If both win/squeeze, the entire economy/country and possibly even the world will change. This isn't just about stocks anymore. This could be the  largest (and due to the new DTCC rule, possibly last) transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.

 Yes I'm sad I was to late to join GME to begin with, but it isn't done. I'm in AMC now. And if AMC pops first, as soon as it's done I will come support my brothers and sisters in GME 100%. If it pops after, I'll still be rooting. If  AMC doesn't ever pop, I won't be angry at GME. And if GME doesn't pop ill be there to welcome them to AMC. 

To me, this isn't about apes vs apes vs hedgies. This is people that have been put down, oppressed, and she ved to the side, vs people who (for the most part) got lucky, and designed this whole system to keep them up, and us down. 

So support AMC, support GME but most of all support your fellow human who is going thru this as much as you. Who has problems like you do. 6 months ago, all of the shit that is being said about AMC now, was being said about GME.

Discussion,Can the MMs and HFs keep artificially increasing GME float (synthetic shares) to keep kicking the short-squeeze down the road?,90,m6njm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6njm8/can_the_mms_and_hfs_keep_artificially_increasing/,100,1615969404.0,"Not a financial or legal advisor.  Honest question.

I'm a pretty sophisticated ape.  Unless I am missing something, the only way for 106.46% of float to be held by Institutions and 21.88% of the float to be held by Insiders (data courtesy of Trade-Ideas) is if some of the shares held long are synthetic shares.  How is that even possible (rhetorical question)?  My understanding is synthetic shares are used to ensure liquidity in the options market; but the I.O.U's are supposed to be settled with actual shares if an option is exercised.  Rather than spend hours studying the regs, I will just assume either (1) the rules do not impose a sufficient amount of audit/reconciliation requirements; or (2) rules are being broken.

Either way, it seems the MMs and HFs have been able to ""create"" synthetic shares, which are then sold and purchased ""long"" in the market.  Apart from confirming how rigged and fucked up the system is; can't they just keep this game up forever?  In other words, can't they just purchase a bunch of in-the-money call options and exercise them to ""buy back"" the shares and return them to the lender? There is a theory that is what the hedgies tried to do last week in their short ladder attack (and that it was actually the Hedgies that had purchased the $300 and $325 call options; and, that it was the long whales who prevented the price from being $300 last Friday so the hedgies could not exercise their options as they are running out of shares held long).

BTW: I am bullish on GME and have a large position.  So certainly not to rain on anyone's parade.

\*\*\*EDIT 1\*\*\* My karma is too low to respond to comments.  I get the data out there is different on what the % held by institutions actually is.  But the question remains that the amount of shares held long > the float.

\*\*\*EDIT 2\*\*\* I am a big time technical trader.  The stock certainly is not behaving normally.  It is constantly being manipulated (hence the dive on extremely low volume pre-market this morning, which induced a minor panic sell).  The fact that so much manipulation is going on of the stock price tells me this story is far from over.

***Edit 3*** I understand how short selling works. I understand that brokers irresponsibly lend out the same share multiple times. But before we even get to what the ""true"" short float is, we have institutional+insider+retail who hold > 100% of the float. That alone should cause the infinity squeeze (even if the short float were only 20%). But they keep finding shares to short....if they are not ""real"" shares, what are they? And if the same share is lent to shorts multiple times, the same share is owned long by multiple people. Yet the MMs still sold thousands of call options last week (hundreds of which were in the money). How can options even be sold if there are no shares available?",2021-03-17 04:23:24

**Let me start by stating the obvious:**

This entire post reflects my personal opinion and is in no way financial advice. And for full transparency I also want you to know that I'm holding shares in GME and would financially benefit from any increase in price.

Elliot Wave Theory

[ Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below... ](https://preview.redd.it/idm32ufg5hn61.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=9998fee714a9de34c57496decc0b0084514bcfd6)

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.

https://reddit.com/link/m6mkl8/video/vsm22l8l5hn61/player

As you can see, our fellow 🦍 Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"". Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

[ Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/1vuhwi4n5hn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=04cb758cc44e447e13e8362cce604c11bd12085d)

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

[ Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/tz9lls9p5hn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=01894662f90ac0d8e184b0d53749adafc7944245)

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mind-blowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. 🤯 I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

#  So you are telling me that fellow 🦍 Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first 🚀 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

[Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January](https://preview.redd.it/11kyqyv46hn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dec899ebec3a26559848da7a73b3e0aff094162)

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our 🚀 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

[What actually happened after that \\""prediction\\""?](https://preview.redd.it/ghttkcd76hn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd51527a0311b975640fe30d2aa07c4720a3b1b)

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our 🚀 take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

# OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

[Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.](https://preview.redd.it/aehej23b6hn61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e68b932cde18ea852691290e7e8300bacedb4a)

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

[🚀 Pre-Launch](https://preview.redd.it/jf5g20sc6hn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd207b34169180baa9573f43a85b88ff66a3d019)

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few 📄 🙌 bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our 🚀 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the 🚀 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**

**EDIT #1:** I started learning the Elliot Wave Theory last year. Two predictions I published last year based on Elliot Waves were the [A-B-C correction in TWLO in October](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TWLO/JJ2castF-Twilio/) (although my floor for C was a little too low) and wave [3-4-5 for TSLA and the $2,000+ price target in July](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/iTTc7EjH-Tesla-Going-for-2-000/) (unfortunately, the stock split ruins the replay, but you can check the chart for yourself to see how accurate my predictions were)

**EDIT #2:** Since some of you are asking if all of that even applies during a squeeze I looked for a chart of a recent short squeeze and if you take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10neu61](https://prnt.sc/10neu61) you'll see that the TSLA squeeze in 2019 also follows the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave pattern.

**EDIT #3:** In addition to ""EDIT #2"" to prove another point, take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10nezpr](https://prnt.sc/10nezpr) and you'll notice that wave #3 of the TSLA squeeze by itself is another 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave.

**EDIT #4:** [https://prnt.sc/10nh43c](https://prnt.sc/10nh43c) shows the weekly GME chart with Elliot Waves from the low last year until now and also indicates that we are currently in wave #3 that will take us to $9,193 - $10,805 followed by wave #4 (short drop not visible in the screenshot) and our final take-off with wave #5 (also not in the screenshot).

**EDIT #6 (#5 is at the top): Here are a few things I personally won't do:**

1. **I won't try to trade those waves, but simply HOLD because I don't want to risk missing the take-off because those price levels aren't set in stone or guaranteed.**
2. **I won't sell on the way up but wait for the top and sell on the way down. Because the price could go way higher than predicted and I rather sell at 80% of the top on the way down than selling at $100k per share** [just to see the top at $1,000,000 or higher](https://prnt.sc/10ni1ei).
3. **I won't invest money that I can't afford to lose.**

**EDIT #7:** Updated link in Edit #6 to include wave #5 prediction on GME weekly chart. Although, I want to point out that I rely on the hourly chart and use higher and/or lower timeframes only for confirmation.

Shares to lend have been nearly non-existent for weeks.  Only 4.6 million shares short covered this week.  Daily utilization is nearly 100% of float.  Reported SI is 44% but is that possible?

They are shorting 7mm shares daily.  14 million so far this week, not counting prior weeks where they were forcing sideways movement/decreases by shorting...

These hedge players I read recently have been fined 58 times for violations which include under reporting shares shorted.  IOW, they will lie about their short position, and count the fine as cost of doing business.

Going through short volume numbers by week since 1/14 through 3/15 provides some interesting insight.  We know our starting point was 140% short interest.

Total long volume since 1/14 is 764603691 shares

Total (reported) short volume is 743764136 shares

Now if we take the absurd position that EVERY long share sold was to cover a short...  I know it's impossible but just play along...

Taking that position, we see that 20839555 shares short were covered.

GME's float is 45MM shares.  140% SI would be  63MM shares short.

So using the numbers THEY reported, there would still be 43MM shares short, or 96% SI

WSB has 9MM members.  Even if only 25% of members here own a absurdly conservative estimate of 2 shares, that is  4.5MM shares, or roughly 10% of float.

When we subtract those numbers from the overall long totals and recalculate the previously ridiculously conservative prior estimate the outcome is 106% SI.

However, my gut feeling is WSB probably owns 50-75% of float at this time which means that the actual number of shares short (as reported) actually increased anywhere from 1.6MM to 12.9MM, resulting in actual SI of somewhere around 146% to 169%.

If the HF's are underreporting, then that number could be insanely high.

TLDR:  It's is numerically impossible the SI has decreased from Jan 14th and has actually risen anywhere to 146%-169%.",2021-03-17 03:05:51

DD,RKT Catalyst coming at the right time before the Triple Witching 3/19.,418,m6lwvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6lwvt/rkt_catalyst_coming_at_the_right_time_before_the/,182,1615964535.0,"**Hello friends,**

In the past few weeks I was have been trying to get positioned into RKT. I have been eyeing this thing for months and finally was able to grab a position today after all the chaos the past few weeks.

Well lets dive deep into some analysis why this could be huge short term and long term.

In the short term I see a lot of upside potential with 100% return or more if we can trigger the gamma squeeze this Friday 3/19 which is very possible with all the indicators I will cover in this post.

Short Interest is up:

Todays Volume was a bit lower than the Daily Average: **15M Volume**

The stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.

RKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT)

**Shorts still in the game:**

As of March 13th 20.8M shares are still short, representing $537,000,000, 6% fee.

During the mini-squeeze only about 1/3 of shorts left, and many re-shorted (data convoluted on this and you know how easy it is for them to 'opps under report').

Check out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).

So the float is about 100 million shares making it 2-2.5 billion. However the company is 50 billion

In other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.

Also remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.

[DTCC Rule](https://preview.redd.it/sy0i9annvgn61.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f92e73f2ada0b0483aef46f515cd3c8494ca5b7)

**Housing data comes out March 17th:**

This will show what we all already know, housing market is on FIRE.

1. Housing prices are rising: This motivates new construction, home renovations and people to sell at a profit.
2. Employment is strengthening.
3. Economy is re-bounding.
4. Work From Home: people want more space, are migrating from cities and condos to houses in the suburbs.
5. Low rates continue.

**Open Call Options:**

Look at the open call options of RKT for Friday March 19th, 49,856 contracts at $28.89!!! We are currently at $26.44!!! If we hit that strike by Friday, we could have a huge Gamma Squeeze which would lead to other short squeezes on higher strike prices as well, at the same day!

RKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers.

**Stimulus + Triple Witching:**

Stimulus checks hit the banks **March 17th.** This is a major catalyst for the entire market as a whole but the trending stocks on reddit will accumulate a good portion of those stimulus checks IMO.

Triple witching:

Triple witching is the quarterly expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index option contracts all on the same day.

Triple witching happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.

Triple witching days, particularly the final hour of trading preceding the closing bell—called the ""triple witching hour""—can result in escalated trading activity and volatility as traders close, roll out, or offset their expiring positions.

The housing market is absolutely on fire and if you click all these links.... GL lol but it shows we are MOONING and so is the Housing market.

What does this mean for ROCKET?! Well it indicates that Rocket is a healthy safe stock to be invested in long term. The current price is such a fire sale it isn't even comparable to what we will see in 5-10 years from now.

Inflation is about to take place and we may see 5-10% increase in the housing market rapidly and we have no control of this.

This is Bullish for Rocket and thats why I will be holding Rocket Long term.

**TLDR:**

**RKT is going to Gamma squeeze if we break $29.00 and 3/19 triple witching will push the price past previous highs.**

**RKT is a great short term and long term play.**

**RKT catalysts, Stimulus, Open Calls, Housing Data March 17th, Short interest 35%, and Triple witching 3/19.**

DD,If you still have doubts about the infamous ”Naked Shortings” or ”how can a stock have more shares than 100% of the outstanding float?” let me clear that out,221,m6ls2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ls2r/if_you_still_have_doubts_about_the_infamous_naked/,38,1615964157.0,"**TR;LD:** Institutions uses Alternative Trading (ATs) mechanism called Traderbots (HFT, high -frequency trading algos) to insert large positions in the markets using dark pools (hidden positions). Dark pools are private exchange for trading securities that are not available for the investing public, this form of transaction keeps the identity of the parts secret. This process of trading is legal, but it has a loophole where it can be used for fraud and market manipulation. This function allows ”naked shorting” by borrowing shares from someone who owns the shares and duplicating them by putting the synthetic shares back in the market without the duplicate number being noticed, which creates outstanding float discrepancies. Discrepancies on time to deliver shares happens because of settlement periods, these processes are common and part of the market in large. But intentional ”naked shorting” when shares are not available and instead of synthetic shares are released is illegal. 



**How does this happen?**


Alternative trading mechanisms (ATs) are algorithm trading bots used by institutions (brokerage -clearing firms, other trading venues, etc.) to process large orders at a lower risk. These transactions are made by HTFs (high-frequency trading) which process large numbers of trades in a manner of milliseconds. 

The reason why ATs were designed is to avoid market volatility, large transactions can induce volatility if they are placed all in once. ATs bots, called Traderbots, distribute the shares in parts as they see fit in the market using dark pools, a hidden process, to limit disruptions on the price by prematurely revealing the positioning of large investors and institutional clients. But the mechanism of dark pools does also presents a potential conflict of interest between trading companies and their affiliates. 

At first, ATs and their regulations were designed to trade shares in form of ”block transactions” around **10k** to **500k** in size, these transactions are charged a lower price fee than the average market pays for because of their size. That is fundamentally why ATs exists, this system is regulated and there is nothing illegal about it. The problem is when institutions use these ATs for manipulating the market. Namely, in the attached article, as ”*toxic*” market participant (bad *behavior* by market makers). In a data research, attached in the paper, it was discovered that instead of “block transactions,” where large amount of trades are made, the number of shares that are regularly exchanged are on average of **181 shares** per transaction.

There is no transparecency in the way how markets institution and affiliates uses ATs, if they don't get caught it is discretionary to *them* to check the wrongdoing.

_**Here is Barclay’s disclaimer piece**_ from their analysis misuse of dark pools, which they were fined and apologized for:

“*The analysis also determined that the trading venues to which Barclays routed unfilled orders (after first having routed them to its dark pool) tended to be venues hosted by high-speed trading firms, “[n]one of which*,” recalled one Director, “*had a reputation for being favorable to clients from an execution perspective.*” Those venues included Knight Capital, Getco, and Citadel.

*These clients, sited above, is anyone who uses brokerages firms, meaning anyone who trades independently (**YOU**) or not in the market.*


_**How these companies uses this leverage and create a toxic market participant behavior?**_

a) front-runs transactions, 

b)  void regulation, 

c)  sell securities short without borrowing (referred to as naked short sales by the SEC), 

d) constantly enters orders it intends to cancel for the purpose of spoofing the market, 

e) layers trades on top of each other not intending to execute them, but as a means to control the marketplace pricing (price suppression),

f) virtually provide services on demand for its clients regardless of whether they are operating legally or not, what Shitatel provides for HF like Melvin Capital.

*Does that sounds familiar???*

A lot of institutions uses ATs in smaller fractions traded on a millisecond speed-when you see your level ll and ”times and sales” charts running so fast that you can't track the numbers; that is what we are talking about. Or large body or very long-tailed candles out of context with the overall price action; that is HFT as well. There are many ways how institutions can use this algos to manipulate the market and when they don't have the shares, they borrow from someone else creating a synthetic (fake) share. That is when the number of shares doesn't add to the outstanding float.

The author of the paper went a step forward saying that ”ATSs and dark pools are in essence, a *private market*.”

The idea is that these forms of trading by High-frequency traders such as Traderbot using dark pools, when misused, harm price discovery altering the fundamental functioning of the capital markets. 

**How is this becomes illegal?**

”If dark pool operators route client trades to a cooperating third party and then become the other side to those trades, then dark pools would be acting for their benefit as opposed to protecting their institutional client and providing a fair and efficient market. Moreover, this hypothetical scenario would constitute illegal pre-arranged trading in violation of a number of securities laws. This would clearly be against the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and is contrary to the spirit of Regulation ATS and the anti-fraud provisions of federal law.”

When a share is sold by a market maker to an institution, then to the investor by the same Traderbot that operates from the clearhouses to it's affiliates is where transparency lacks and it’s intent can become malicious practices. Where can be short sales not backed by borrowed assets, a.k.a. ”naked shorting” sold for full price and incooporated to the ATs operator’s books (not sent to NSCC/DTCC for clearance and settlement). Which results in undisclosed securities positions and numbers exceeding the number of shares security has on their total float. Such as we see in GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. It’s one of the techniques that shitty HF uses to hedge themselves in the market.

**Why is important to understand this?**


This process of naked shorting is recurrent in GME. At every ”fail to deliver” the shares have have been duplicated to cover the one's prior to it (if I understood correctly). Once there is no available shares to borrow from the limited float of the stock HF are creating more and more counterfeit shares to hedge their positions and keep profiting. While preying on the collapse of the stock. Which they will benefit and leave with millions and millions of dollares. HF tactics is to drive the company into bankruptcy, after all once that happens no one will care to count the shares. HF will take the profits, so it doesn't matter for them to repeat the process until they have active success.

If you having read it yet, [check this](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf)  from u/gafgarian

As long as prices remain higher, this tactic not only become a major economic risk for HF but it increases the potential of GME short squeeze. Eventually, they have to deliver their shares and get out of the market. It's a matter of who gets tired first.

DD,Citadel Regulations DD,282,m6lgf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6lgf8/citadel_regulations_dd/,42,1615963205.0,"Reposting as God damnit apes I spent hours going through this and I don't think enough have seen it.

Welcome back to another episode of my legal series DD, where brokers manipulate the market and the fines don’t matter.

I hear some say, well Citadel has paid fines without a finding out guilt, gave no admission and were censured (which is a fancy wrist slap) when they breached the rules, so they would never do it again right? 

**Wrong**. Basically, Citadel has only ever paid a relatively pathetic ‘oh no I got caught’ fee for each breach, and it barely puts a dent into the cost of doing business.

My aim is to help apes, in that bu knowing their history of breaches, this will prepare you for when you see price action related to what we all know to be fuckery from excellent DD. 

I hope this will give you a better insight into their tactics as the MOASS approaches.

These disclosures have been brought up before, but those posts I’ve seen did not go into too much detail, and whilst I appreciate many other brokers have disclosures, Citadel are the ape understood broker with the highest likelihood of being short in GME, so let’s dig in. Buckle up apes, this one may take a little while and raised even my eyebrows.

As always, not financial advice, always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

Citadel has a total of 59 disclosures. In order to understand whether this is a lot, I compared them to our friends at Blackrock, who have only 1. *There are big boys with more than Citadel mind.*

Blackrock’s total fines? $2,955 for an omission of fact (likely a clerical error).

Citadel’s? **$33,425,568** for a whole host of things, and yes, I added them all up to arrive at this number.

Whilst I know you may think this is a puny sum for a firm worth billions (and it is), this is the fault of the law on maximum fines, not necessarily the agencies themselves. It's better to look at the **staggering relative difference between the 2**.

Let’s see my highlight reel of the top 10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1 - Case 3-17772, 01/13/2017 - **$22,668,268 Sanction: Disgorgement/Restitution, Monetary Fine & a Cease and Desist/Injuction**

Summary: From late 2007 through January 2010; despite Citadel saying they provide ‘best execution’ for their clients two of their algorithms did **not**, scalping some $5.2mm from their client brokers. They paid this back with a relatively hefty fee slapped on top and the suit was brought due to fraudulently stating they gave best execution when 0.6% of their trades didn’t in this period. These algorithms have allegedly been discontinued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 - Case SEC FILE NO 3-18915, 12/10/2018 - **$3,500,000:  Monetary Fine & Cease and Desist/Injunction**

Summary: From November 2012 – August 2016, Citadel failed to report complete and accurate data on around 80 million trades despite multiple requests from the SEC, which undermines the SEC’s potential ability to properly regulate and protect consumers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3 Case 2010023518001, 10/19/2016 - **$1,000,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel had an algo strategy, which traded a very high concentration of securities orders just prior to market open, impacting the proper pricing of securities. In addition, this algo strategy had a complete lack of oversight from someone with any qualifications. Their supervision was criticized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 Case 2016051085001, 10/27/2020 - **$180,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Between September 2015 and July 2016, Citadel had a self-described ‘system issue’ which resulted in a failure to properly mark short positions in accordance with new rules. *once again*, supervisory issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 Case STAR NO. 20180580176 / FILE NO. USRI-8731, 02/28/2020 - **$10,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel security **failed to close out fails to deliver**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#6 Case 20190500001, 02/07/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel improperly cancelled 231 Market-on-Close orders relating to a single basket of securities and, I've heard this before, *once again* failed to properly supervise their systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#7 Case 20180590083, 01/23/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel **allowed best prices and execution of trades during a circuit breaker event** and you guessed it, **once again** lacked proper supervisory procedures. I’m getting the impression this is intentional so they can just deliberately say ‘oh X didn’t know, they’re not trained!’ as a bullshit fallback for a billion dollar company.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#8 Case 2016-07-1306, 09/29/2017 - **$80,000 Sanction: Censure& Monetary Fine**

Summary: Through July 2014 and September 2016, Citadel failed to grant priority to the national best bid for securities and **once  a fucking gain, failed to implement proper supervisory procedures**. This best bid shit is *not* the first of its kind, and it's where Citadel makes their $$$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#9 Case 20080157728-01, 09/03/2015 - **$200,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: From February 2006 – August 2009, Citadel delayed execution for orders over 10,000 shares on penny stocks; From February 2006 – February 2009, Citadel deleted its e-mail communications (**suspect as fuuuuuck**); and ONCE AGAIN, **their supervisory procedures were deficient**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#10 Case 2010022334502, 06/16/2014 - **$800,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: On 24 occasions, through March 18, 2010 to February 28, 2014 Citadel **manipulated an exchange exploit to cancel orders**; in April 2010, **used an out-dated software to allow exchanges to create them an erroneous short position**; in August 2011, updated their software to cause an order sending and cancellation loop; On December 13, 2012, used inaccurate market data to **capitalise on limit orders**; and finally, sent millions of orders to the exchanges **without execution and removed a limit imposed on Citadel which prevented them from making 200 orders per second**.

Fuck me.

 

So what does this tell us?

 

From #1 we know Citadel looks out for itself only, it’ll fuck over their clients, exchange and retail alike to profit.

From #2 we know Citadel will report inaccurate data even to its regulatory body to fuck with their ability to regulate properly (SLD and Clearing Fund anyone?).

From #3 we know Citadel will use algo strategies which break the rules to profit for themselves.

From #4 we know Citadel has a history of failing to properly disclose short positions.

From #5 we know Citadel will fail to settle Failures to Deliver.

From #6 we know Citadel will abandon their responsibility as a market maker to enrich themselves and cancel orders.

From #7 we know Citadel will allow trades during circuit breakers to enrich themselves.

From #8 we know Citadel will provide bids below the national best bid for, I imagine, brokers they pay for order flow for (*cough, Robinhood, cough*).

From #9 we know Citadel will mess with orders and then likely DELETE EVIDENCE IMPLICATING THEM.

From #10, Jesus Christ, we know Citadel doesn’t give a **fuck about market manipulation.**

TLDR: Citadel doesn’t give a fuck about anyone or anything else other than itself, and it WILL do everything it can to prevent the MOASS as their continuous and systematic breaches of the rules proves.

Know thy enemy apes, **expect fuckery from here on out**.",2021-03-17 02:40:05

If you're still on that piece of trash platform you're essentially choosing to stay in an abusive relationship. RH showed in January that they either can't or won't support you during large market events. The reasons why don't even matter, they can't. 

Harken back to the Cuban AMA. Remember that? One of his foremost pieces of advice was to get a real broker with a trillion dollar balance sheet. Fidelity or Vanguard, pick one. Doesn't matter which they're both boomer hellscapes to interact with but they at least have your back.

Now do a partial account transfer. This is \*faster\* than a full account transfer and just transfers specific shares of your choosing. I did this and transferred my volatile shares to Fidelity and they were only in limbo for a day or two. Then I did my full account transfer separately, and that took about two weeks of which 4 days or so the shares were truly locked up.

If this seems too hard then maybe you should know that there is a non-zero chance RH may disable *selling* during the squeeze. Did you see that recent offering to give you cash for deposits? They're desperate for money and on their last legs. If anyone asks them for a big chunk of collateral they are instantly GOING TO FOLD AGAIN. It might sound harsh but if this happens and your shit is locked up and you can't sell, that's your own damn fault. It's been a month and a half that people have been screaming to get a real broker.

PLUG power down hard after hours due to news that there are some small accounting errors. I believe this is a great buy in and been meaning to release some DD on it that it is a very underrated stock. Why? They're a legit company and the better of the fuel cell stocks (FCEL for example) with contracts in Europe and Korea.

\- Korea recently invested in them at **30$ a share**. Should be a floor.

\- Energy pull back recent weeks. This is easily a 100$ stock by next year

\- Legit company, not like Nikola. Their glassdoor even has a hiring *SURGE*:

Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power, said, “Since our founding nearly 25 years ago, Plug Power has prided itself on operating ***with transparency and integrity, and we are working to resolve this matter quickly. Importantly, there is no expected impact to our cash position, business operations or economics of commercial arrangements***. We continue to execute on our mission to provide customers with state-of-the-art fuel cell and green hydrogen solutions. We remain confident in our ability to leverage our strong business momentum and market leading technologies, independently and alongside our joint venture partners, to capture the significant business opportunities in this rapidly growing industry.

We were humming along this week quite nicely with all signs pointing to a strong gamma ramp that would push the price well beyond $30, cause massive buying and likely push even higher than last time. 

However, a hedge fund(Melvin, is that you?) or other big player with heavy puts or sold calls against RKT didn't want that to happen.

This afternoon there was a 400k share (~$10M) short bet. That likely trigged stop limits and de-hedging by market makers causing the price to drop even further. It was timed during low volume for maximum effect(wiping out the bid side). It was meant to control the price. There was also heavy put activity today holding it back(possibly by the same entity). Shorts are trying to take back control before the 03/19 expiry happens.

The 03/19 expiry has huge open interest, especially at the $28.89 level. If Rocket had continued the 3% daily from Monday, we'd have hit $28.99 on Friday(and likely sooner as the gamma ramp kicked in). This short bet today was pure manipulation. Timed for maximum effect to ensure RKT doesn't have time to recover before Friday.

The gamma squeeze is still possible, but not without heavy retail buy-in. If RKT breaks $27 for a sustained time period with the $25.89 and $26.89 open interest going in the money, breaking the $29 barrier that would kick-off a gamma squeeze becomes a real possibility.

I truly believe RKT is worth far more than it's trading at. I like this stock.

Position: Shares and about 150 calls at various strikes from $23.89 to $32.89 overall position size ~$10k after today's drop. Plan on another 150 shares with my stimulus.

Edit: Got Stimy today and 170 shares at a discount. Still holding my Calls.",2021-03-17 01:08:26

Nokia Corporation (NOK)

Market Cap $24.2bn

52 week Range $2.34 to $9.79

This is no longer the company that produced mobile phones and it's a while (8 years) since they moved away from phones when selling the whole division. They are a seamless 5G platform supplier. In fact they are one of only two companies anywhere with the capability to supply a continuous end to end 5g network platform. The other company is Huawei (I shall not swear any more.)

The only issue with Nokia is that they are not forthcoming and the information released to the public very much underplays how well the company is progressing. Previously the opposite approach this has artificially boosted the share price but as the business moves forward this is holding the share price down....and for a very good reason. I have come to suspect, that from several conversations with people I know at large institutions (who avoided talking about Nokia at all costs) that some large positions are being built up stealthily. Previously such avoidance of talking about companies has resulted in SEC filings showing large purchases during the previous quarter. This may be the reason why they didn't dip too far below $4 during the recent market drop.

Back to where Nokia is really at.

About 88% of revenue comes from wireless network infrastructure and products and internet routing equipment. 10 years of acquisitions have seen the transformation into a leading wireless technology company. In 2016 the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent which included Bell Labs. This made them into a potential giant along side the 'H' company and Ericsson.

Powering its ASIC-powered base station and 5G platform with it's new artificial intelligence ReefShark semiconductor saves around 50% energy usage and makes the product cheaper to customers.

This product is the ideal solution for Mobile Virtual Network Operators. There are between 800 and 1200 worldwide. When software development catches up the big tech and social network companies will have their own wireless service running autonomously. There is potential in cities to bring a network up to an astounding capability of over 5Tbps (yes terabytes) that means each loop can have 5000 customers with 1Gbps service. Reefshark makes Nokia the top of the pile in this massive coming market. And unlike Ericsson it's all in house and no need for partners. The 'H' company is banned from a number of significant countries so Nokia is ideally placed to pick up that business.

Nokia are stripping fitter by reducing operating costs and will shed a few thousand jobs. This could save $500M a year. 

At $4.30 the shares are cheap. Apart from a few shrewd institutions Nokia is currently ignored by most of the Wall Street sharks. It's typical of the attitude towards an overseas based company. The institutions that have got the jump on building up their stake in Nokia will be celebrating by the end of the year when the rest of Wall Street wants a piece of the action. $8-$10 is what I am expecting.

The price has crept up every day for the past week and could gather more momentum as the company gets a real grip on their business. It all looks good to me.

DD,DD on Vonage Holding Corp (VG),4,m6ipxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ipxf/dd_on_vonage_holding_corp_vg/,15,1615955694.0,"*Intro:*
Vonage is a communications company offering voice, messaging, video and data capabilities across unified communications, contact centers and API’s.    The company was started in 1998 with a focus in VoIP,  and IPO’d in 2006.     

Currently, VG is in the process of transforming from the legacy consumer communications business to a CPaaS (Communication Platform as a Service) company. 
 
Prior to 2020 CPaaS sector was growing as companies focused on digital transformation and omni-channel customer engagement.   The pandemic further accelerated this trend with the need for enterprise communication tools to manage remote work. 
 
VG is not best of breed in its industry and does not have any unique functionality that leads me to believe it will substantially eat into the market share of the industry leaders.  However, the CPaaS total addressable market is growing rapidly so there is room for VG to grow, nonetheless.  
 
Avg daily volume 3.68m on 249 million shares outstanding with 97% owned by institutions.
 
*Competitors:*
Ticker/Market Cap/FY20 Rev/FY20 Grwth/ P/S

TWLO / 65b / 1.76b / 55% / 31.2

RNG   / 31b / 1.1b    / 31%./ 26.1

BAND / 3.2b /343m / 49% /  9.1

VG     /3.1b /1.25b.  / 6%  /   2.4

*I only picked standalone competitors but it is worth noting Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and other big players have offerings or are working on offerings in this space.
 
*The case for VG:*
As you can see above, the headline growth number for VG is ugly compared to other CPaaS players and the valuation on a P/S basis reflects that fact.   VG revenue compares favorably to Ring Central but has just one tenth the market cap at present.   Simply put, VG is not valued as a growth CPaaS company at present, but when you break down the earnings report, I believe there is a case to be made that it should.  VG has two main segments the legacy consumer segment and the VCP (communications platform). 
 
Legacy consumer segment revenues were 333 million for FY20, a decrease of 14% yoy and is expected to continue decline over the next few years.   VG thoroughly investigated selling this segment but has opted against it.  This business is profitable, and the cash generation will help to fund continued investment into their new offerings.  Nonetheless, the decline in this segment is a drag on earnings.
 
Looking at the VCP segment is a different picture altogether.   FY2020 for VCP revenues were 856m, a 19% increase.  Further, the VCP API segment, the highest value segment grew at 33% and is expected to grow 34-36% in 1Q21.   Overall VCP segment revenue grew to 76% of total revenue from 70% prior year.   The CPaaS business is clearly becoming the dominant business within VG and is much healthier than the headline numbers would indicate.   Additionally, VG has been working on operational efficiencies to reduce expenses while investing in their new offerings.  
 
I believe VG is due to be revalued as a CPaaS company,  with a higher P/S multiple than it currently has.   VG management agrees, and this quarter they have started to report earnings in a way that highlights the strength of the VCP business.  Management also noted they will be focusing on driving Rule of 40 metrics (revenue growth + margin &amp;gt; 40) which is a common measure for SaaS companies.
 
FY21 VCP segment revenues are projected at just over 1b alone and total VG revenues expected 1.32b.   Discounting the entire legacy business, a P/s of 5 on 2021 VCP revenues alone would be a 40% increase from current prices. 
 
8Risk:*
The primary risk is execution risk as VG builds out its newer business.  Margins are currently below industry SaaS and CPaaS leaders and management needs to continue to manage expenses while growing the business. 

Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are both neutral and of the opinion that this story may take multiple quarters to play out but are encouraged by the plan.     Avg Price target is $15.36 by 15 analysts (6 strong buy, 4 buy, 5 hold).
 
This is a space with tons of new competition and missteps could result in a lagging position that is difficult to rebound from.
 
*My Plan:*
As this is a turnaround / transformation play, I do not expect out/under performance without VG specific news or earnings reports.   8/20 13c $1.45 would allow me to capture 2 earnings reports to see confirmation or rejection of my thesis with minimal risk.  
 
Let me know what you all think!

TLDR: Vonage is a CPaaS company priced like a more like traditional telecom due to its declining legacy business.  This will change as their transformation continues to progress.

DD,Citadel Regulatory Breaches – Know thy enemy DD,606,m6iptw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6iptw/citadel_regulatory_breaches_know_thy_enemy_dd/,113,1615955686.0,"Welcome back to another episode of my legal series DD, where brokers manipulate the market and the fines don’t matter.

I hear some say, well Citadel has paid fines without a finding out guilt, gave no admission and were censured (which is a fancy wrist slap) when they breached the rules, so they would never do it again right? 

**Wrong**. Basically, Citadel has only ever paid a relatively pathetic ‘oh no I got caught’ fee for each breach, and it barely puts a dent into the cost of doing business.

My aim is to help apes, in that bu knowing their history of breaches, this will prepare you for when you see price action related to what we all know to be fuckery from excellent DD. 

I hope this will give you a better insight into their tactics as the MOASS approaches.

These disclosures have been brought up before, but those posts I’ve seen did not go into too much detail, and whilst I appreciate many other brokers have disclosures, Citadel are the ape understood broker with the highest likelihood of being short in GME, so let’s dig in. Buckle up apes, this one may take a little while and raised even my eyebrows.

As always, not financial advice, always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.

Citadel has a total of 59 disclosures. In order to understand whether this is a lot, I compared them to our friends at Blackrock, who have only 1. *There are big boys with more than Citadel mind.*

Blackrock’s total fines? $2,955 for an omission of fact (likely a clerical error).

Citadel’s? **$33,425,568** for a whole host of things, and yes, I added them all up to arrive at this number.

Whilst I know you may think this is a puny sum for a firm worth billions (and it is), this is the fault of the law on maximum fines, not necessarily the agencies themselves. It's better to look at the **staggering relative difference between the 2**.

Let’s see my highlight reel of the top 10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1 - Case 3-17772, 01/13/2017 - **$22,668,268 Sanction: Disgorgement/Restitution, Monetary Fine & a Cease and Desist/Injuction**

Summary: From late 2007 through January 2010; despite Citadel saying they provide ‘best execution’ for their clients two of their algorithms did **not**, scalping some $5.2mm from their client brokers. They paid this back with a relatively hefty fee slapped on top and the suit was brought due to fraudulently stating they gave best execution when 0.6% of their trades didn’t in this period. These algorithms have allegedly been discontinued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 - Case SEC FILE NO 3-18915, 12/10/2018 - **$3,500,000:  Monetary Fine & Cease and Desist/Injunction**

Summary: From November 2012 – August 2016, Citadel failed to report complete and accurate data on around 80 million trades despite multiple requests from the SEC, which undermines the SEC’s potential ability to properly regulate and protect consumers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3 Case 2010023518001, 10/19/2016 - **$1,000,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel had an algo strategy, which traded a very high concentration of securities orders just prior to market open, impacting the proper pricing of securities. In addition, this algo strategy had a complete lack of oversight from someone with any qualifications. Their supervision was criticized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 Case 2016051085001, 10/27/2020 - **$180,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Between September 2015 and July 2016, Citadel had a self-described ‘system issue’ which resulted in a failure to properly mark short positions in accordance with new rules. *once again*, supervisory issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 Case STAR NO. 20180580176 / FILE NO. USRI-8731, 02/28/2020 - **$10,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel security **failed to close out fails to deliver**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#6 Case 20190500001, 02/07/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel improperly cancelled 231 Market-on-Close orders relating to a single basket of securities and, I've heard this before, *once again* failed to properly supervise their systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#7 Case 20180590083, 01/23/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: Citadel **allowed best prices and execution of trades during a circuit breaker event** and you guessed it, **once again** lacked proper supervisory procedures. I’m getting the impression this is intentional so they can just deliberately say ‘oh X didn’t know, they’re not trained!’ as a bullshit fallback for a billion dollar company.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#8 Case 2016-07-1306, 09/29/2017 - **$80,000 Sanction: Censure& Monetary Fine**

Summary: Through July 2014 and September 2016, Citadel failed to grant priority to the national best bid for securities and **once  a fucking gain, failed to implement proper supervisory procedures**. This best bid shit is *not* the first of its kind, and it's where Citadel makes their $$$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#9 Case 20080157728-01, 09/03/2015 - **$200,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: From February 2006 – August 2009, Citadel delayed execution for orders over 10,000 shares on penny stocks; From February 2006 – February 2009, Citadel deleted its e-mail communications (**suspect as fuuuuuck**); and ONCE AGAIN, **their supervisory procedures were deficient**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#10 Case 2010022334502, 06/16/2014 - **$800,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**

Summary: On 24 occasions, through March 18, 2010 to February 28, 2014 Citadel **manipulated an exchange exploit to cancel orders**; in April 2010, **used an out-dated software to allow exchanges to create them an erroneous short position**; in August 2011, updated their software to cause an order sending and cancellation loop; On December 13, 2012, used inaccurate market data to **capitalise on limit orders**; and finally, sent millions of orders to the exchanges **without execution and removed a limit imposed on Citadel which prevented them from making 200 orders per second**.

Fuck me.

 

So what does this tell us?

 

From #1 we know Citadel looks out for itself only, it’ll fuck over their clients, exchange and retail alike to profit.

From #2 we know Citadel will report inaccurate data even to its regulatory body to fuck with their ability to regulate properly (SLD and Clearing Fund anyone?).

From #3 we know Citadel will use algo strategies which break the rules to profit for themselves.

From #4 we know Citadel has a history of failing to properly disclose short positions.

From #5 we know Citadel will fail to settle Failures to Deliver.

From #6 we know Citadel will abandon their responsibility as a market maker to enrich themselves and cancel orders.

From #7 we know Citadel will allow trades during circuit breakers to enrich themselves.

From #8 we know Citadel will provide bids below the national best bid for, I imagine, brokers they pay for order flow for (*cough, Robinhood, cough*).

From #9 we know Citadel will mess with orders and then likely DELETE EVIDENCE IMPLICATING THEM.

From #10, Jesus Christ, we know Citadel doesn’t give a **fuck about market manipulation.**

TLDR: Citadel doesn’t give a fuck about anyone or anything else other than itself, and it WILL do everything it can to prevent the MOASS as their continuous and systematic breaches of the rules proves.

Financial Times: -1.7413

Yahoo Finance: -2.07

Nasdaq: -2.09

At 16 March 2021.

This is CRAZY. I am currently writing my dissertation for an MSc in Finance and Financial Law. I learned in Corporate Finance that a negative beta stock is like a mythical unicorn, so when I noticed a few weeks ago that GME's beta was -2.01, I interpreted this as some sort of perversion around what is happening with the stock right now but did not understand what it really meant. I have since been investigating this in my own time instead of my actual dissertation topic and this is what I have found - that short selling can create a negative beta - and now GME's beta has fallen even more to as much as -2.09 according to Nasdaq.

**Background theory - IMPORTANT**

What is beta? Beta is a number that reflects the correlation between the price movement of a stock and the movement of the overall market. We do not have the data of the ""real world market"" so the ""market"" of GME is going to be the S&P500. Basically the ""market"" is the universe in which we and all stocks exist. That is why a negative beta is normally not possible. It is like saying that a certain species of animal will thrive and prosper the more the health of the Earth as an environment deteriorates. Yeah, it could happen in an abnormal situation, like an atomic bomb and the cockroach population coming out the winner, but it is not something normal as we all depend for our growth on the market/the Earth.

A beta of 0 means that there is no correlation between the market and the stock.

A beta of 1 means that the stock moves exactly the same as the market, e.g. if market is up 10%, the stock is up 10%.

A beta of more than 1 means that the stock amplifies the market's movement by that much, e.g. if market is up 10%, then a +1 beta stock would go up, e.g. 15%.

A beta of -1 is a perfect negative correlation, so the stock moves exactly the opposite of the market, e.g. if market goes down 10%, the stock goes up 10%.

A beta of less than -1 means this negative correlation is amplified, e.g. market goes down 10%, stock goes up 15%.

An easy online source:

'Negative beta: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely. Some investors argue that gold and gold stocks should have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines.'

[https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/)

**About GME specifically**

Here is the historical beta of GME:

02/28/2021 -2.195

12/31/2020 1.404

09/30/2020 1.084

06/30/2020 1.038

03/31/2020 0.4512

You can see that GME's beta has only been negative since end of Feb 2021. Before that it had a very normal beta of over 1, meaning when the market was doing well, then its business did well too, i.e. people have money to spend on games, etc. Even during most of the lockdown its beta was still quite a bit above 1. But at the end of Feb, it suddenly went all the way down to -2.195. What happened at that time? The massive crash down to $38. Plotkin himself said that the rapid rise in price was not due to shorts covering right? But have they covered since one way or the other? The beta would indicate no because now the beta is even lower, at -2.09. Since Yahoo confirms Nasdaq, I think the FT is sus and in the best case just doesn't update its data. -1.7413 is still remarkable though.

Here is a quote from an academic source by Fabozzi - the author whom I credit with helping me the most to prepare for my Corporate Finance exam - anything he writes is gold and written very clearly with no academic posturing or arrogance:

'So far the implications of systematic risk have been ignored. The beta of a short position is the negative of the beta of a long position, and is hence normally a negative number. In the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return for an investment depends on the correlation of the return from the investment with the other securities in the portfolio, a characteristic that can be measured by its beta.'

[http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/\~straf/allow\_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf](http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/~straf/allow_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf)

See also this author:

'Although the data used in this research consist of net short positions and the tax regulation in the Netherlands is different from USA regulation, a small negative beta is expected to account for end of the year, tax-motivated short selling.'

[https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer\_MA\_MB.pdf](https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer_MA_MB.pdf)

Both authors mention this very casually and by the way because it is so obvious to them. Logically, if the true beta is, say, 1.4 then its beta when shorted must be a negative number. This is very significant for apes who like GME because they keep telling us that there is no more short interest, here's the data, etc. but they can't manipulate the beta. I don't know how the beta is calculated by these news outlets but I think it must be done automatically by the bots and even if FT were a shill and not simply inaccurate, the beta of -1.7413 is still crazy.

For comparison, this academic says:

'Every time I have found a negative beta in practice, there was either a data error or the sample size was too small for the negative beta to be statistically significant...But now there is an interesting real life case of a negative beta stock: Zoom Video Communications, Inc....A better example of beta changing dramatically (going from around two to negative and then back to around two) within a few months without any change in the business mix of the company would be hard to find. ***Negative betas may be a once in a 100-year event \[emphasis added\]***.'

[https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/](https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/)

To me, this is all very strong evidence that the shorts have not covered and are desperate. Due to the absence of reporting requirements for short positions and the other myriad and innovative ways that HFs may be shorting GME that we cannot see, no one has hard numbers for the actual short interest in GME, but ***the beta cannot lie***. Since HFs have been shorting GME since forever and the beta was still more than 1 even during the pandemic, it must have been safe for them ***so long as a large number of investors were not buying up GME and holding***. I am planning another post summarising what Fabozzi says about why, under realistic assumptions, optimists set the price, not pessimists (i.e. short sellers).

DD,How $UWMC can make us all rich Friday - DO NOT WASTE THIS OPPORTUNITY,1120,m6id0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6id0b/how_uwmc_can_make_us_all_rich_friday_do_not_waste/,432,1615954742.0,"TL;DR - $UWMC has MASSIVE OPEN INTEREST on 3/19 calls at or above $10 (see below). **Open Interest** represents the number of outstanding contracts currently in the market aka the number of your diamond hand, bag holding wsb apes holding 3/19 calls.

**What this means is that there are 140,000+ call options that can be exercised at or near $10 this Friday 3/19.** To put this in context that's about 1000% more than the open interest in contracts expiring the following month. If the price reaches $10 and these contracts are exercised it will trigger the mother of all squeezes as each contract exercised will be a buy order of 100 shares. The more people buy the stock, the more it goes up...ape understand?

And it's not just this Friday. $UWMC is a GOOD COMPANY that nearly all analysts have pegged at a buy at current prices. It's about to be added to the Russel this month and for those looking for the full breakdown of the bull case for $UWMC **in the long term as well** and why this Friday is a MAJOR opportunity refer to the threads below:

**ACTION TO TAKE - BUY $UWMC before Friday while it's still under $10**. If we get it to $10 sit back, pop open a beer, and laugh as CNBC talks about how stupid we all are.

**I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard posting on WSB with a bias due to having a large position in $UWMC. So, proceed on your own risk yada yada yada...**

Currently holding 200 @ $10.5 and 3/19 $11 calls

**EDIT TO ORIGINAL POST - - - -**

Alright seeing a lot of negative comments from confused apes out there so TO BE CLEAR

* **I am not** trying to steal attention away from your precious $GME 
* **I am not** saying the options expiring OTM will cause the price to increase
* **I am** saying that *if* the price reaches $10 by 3/19, those contracts can be **exercised OR sold**. **Selling the contracts produces the same result**, because they are bought by someone who will eventually exercises them (i.e. if a wsb ape sells his option instead of exercising it, it just get exercised by the buyer or whomever he sells it to). Sadly we do not live in a world rich enough yet that people will let ITM 0 DTE call options expire without getting their nut.
* **I am** saying that the price has to reach $10 for takeoff **by Friday**. This is realistic considering 3 million shares on 90 million float. Regardless I'd honestly recommend buying shares not options at these prices considering it still hasn't been added to the Russel. 
* **I am** your wife's boyfriend

This is also the last week of the old short rules.  So Hedgies need to make their money.  Others will ignore the perils of the new rules.  Some will cover out of self interest, some will cover out of fear, others won't cover and have to cover later this week.

2. Apes charge GME and AMC, some will hold others may take profits and go back and forth between GME and AMC.  The prices cycle higher as more share can be purchased.  Again retailers see blood in the water and join in.
3. Apes go in all directions.  The majority of which will be GME and AMC.  Other places will see upticks.  Share prices rise and that carries through Friday.  At which point Friday is the last safe day for shorts to get out without facing a ""sudden death"" cover your shit or else call under the new rules.  There will be funds that scoff at the new rules believing they can carry on as usual.

For starters, acknowledge that you're probably going to be touchy, things might set you off. So you're going to need to destress.

Go home, eat a snack, kiss your wife or hug your kids. Now go and do something nice for them. Take out the trash, empty the dish washer, do some chore that you've been putting off. It'll help. I don't know why it helps, but it does.

I think out ape brains can't really weight things objectively so getting a small win offsets a greater loss.

Guess what, it isn't to kill momentum or make people lose faith in the stock! They are doing it simply to increase implied volatility and make options less attractive.


For the smooth brains:

When a stock jumps up and down, it increases something called IMPLIED VOLATILITY or IV. When you go to buy options, this is priced into the cost of the option. If a stock can move by a lot, it makes options contracts MORE EXPENSIVE and LESS ATTRACTIVE.

Not only do ladder attacks lower the share price temporarily which might trigger things like stop losses and drive confidence in the stock DOWN, it hits both of your holes like the ultimate shocker - because it ALSO drives IV through the roof.

What happens when IV goes through the roof? Retards can't spend $1400 on 50 $800C weeklies with the hopes of a big payout, because they are TOO EXPENSIVE. This GRINDS THE GAMMA SQUEEZE to a HALT, and the stock price slowly drops or trades sideways until the volatility settles enough for the average retail moron to be able to afford tons of options contracts again.

We saw this when the stock settled at $40 for a while. As soon as the IV dropped enough where options were attractive again, the stock popped again.

What we are seeing now is the same... if it trades flat for a week or two and the IV plummets - those $400C are going to look like a PRETTY TEMPTING GAMBLE.

When that happens, the options volume is going to skyrocket again - causing the market makers to buy shares to write contracts, and we will see another wild ride.

Here is my DD:

I expect the price to settle, maybe at $180... Maybe at $150... Maybe at $207, but we are going to see a FLAT scenario for a while until another spark lights the fuse and people jump all over those newly reduced price calls and the cycle will happen all over again.",2021-03-17 00:04:22

First of all I apologise for my bad english I'm a 🥖French🥐 retard.

During the past few days I've seen a lot of negative comments about GME. (Maybe from HF bots, but this is not what I want to talk about).

I made this post to ~~confirm your bias~~ reassure people and to recreate a strong unity between each other. In this post, I will show you different arguments on why you should buy now and don't wait. (This is totally speculative as you can expect.)

# Why the price is going down ?

As you can see in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) (Thanks to the community btw).

Apparently Hedge funds are using different strategies to down the prices by short selling shares from ETF (A lot) and also from Brokers.

Because of this the price is going down and some people start to panic and sell their shares (Fuck\*ng 🧻🙌). It also trigger stop loss (this is why you should turn them off.)

# So why I should buy GME now if I know that the price is going down French APE?

* ***Mental War***

Some of you expect that the price will only go up (Stonk) but just to remind you we are playing against the richest people/entity in the world and they are pretty good at ~~stealing~~ making money. They know that by showing red data 🖍️ to us, we are going to be scared and probably sold our positions.

If you buy now, you help the price to not go too much down (or even go up) and you help the cause by reassuring our 🌈🐻.

* ***🇺🇸 AMERICA 🇺🇸***

As I read online and on WSB some of you (American people 💖) are going to receive theirs stimulus of 1400 dollars tomorrow (and some of you today). Most of this stimulus will go into stock and into GME. [(Source)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=43ce08183936)

So we can expect a huge 🚀 tomorrow.

* **Good news and Earning report 23/03**

Despite all the good argument I said before (Jk).

In the next few days we can expect good news from GME (including the earning report) that could lead to a huge catalyst. For now we have to keep the pressure against them and don't forget that it's a war and they are not going to let us win !

Not financial advice and also don't forget to only put the money you can afford to lose !

Also our favorite quote from Warren Buffet : “Be fearful when others are greedy. Be **GREDDY** when others are fearful.”

TLDR: Price down cause of short sells and 🧻🙌 ----> Solution = Buy now and hold 💎🙌 for going to 🚀🌑

I like the stock (16.56@216)

* Other Silicon Valley CEO's think they are too smart and are too  self-righteous 
* Other tech companies are hypocritical to build their companies in the  US but not support the government succeed in the future 
* Other tech companies don't do anything other than build wealth for  themselves 
* When PLTR left the Valley, everyone thought they were crazy.  Now all  those people are leaving the Valley too 
* Palantir is in it for the long haul, building their company the way  they feel is right 
* Wall Street's short-term nature is one of the many things he has to  worry about 
* Short-term investors should look elsewhere 
* He praised retail-investors they are investing their own money,  without a safety net

Put in what article info I could in case of a pay-wall-block

GameStop stock dropped again shortly after the market opened on Tuesday. While some short sellers appeared to cover their bearish bets in recent weeks, a short-selling expert says he still sees plenty of squeeze potential.

Shares were down 19% to $178.12 around 10:30 a.m. Such levels are still many multiples higher than the stock’s one-year low of $2.57.

Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at short-selling analytics firm S3 Partners, told Barron’s on Monday that his firm estimates about 8.98 million GameStop shares (ticker: GME) were recently sold short, about 16% of shares available for trading.

Dusaniwsky said over the last month, his firm has seen about 7.5 million shorts covered, meaning bearish investors bought shares to cover their bets. The bulk came over the past week, when 4.6 million shares were covered.

“GME shorts are going through a short squeeze, and the stock continues to be on of the top stocks in our short squeeze potential metric, which means the squeeze is probably going to continue if its stock price remains at these levels or higher,” Dusaniwsky added.

The company’s shares rocketed higher last week following a company announcement that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen has been chairing a board committee aimed at transforming the retailer into a technology business. Cohen joined the board with two associates in January, kicking off GameStop’s parabolic ascent.
GameStop said it will report fiscal fourth-quarter results on March 23. Analysts expect adjusted earnings of $1.35 a share, up from $1.27 a share in the prior fiscal fourth quarter, according to FactSet. Of course, analysts are far more bearish on GameStop than the retail investors posting on Reddit’s WallStreetBest forum. The highest price target listed by FactSet is $33, while the mean target is $14.64.

I would also like to receive updates and special offers from Dow Jones and affiliates. I can While near-term results could cool off the GameStop rally, those excited about the stock are looking far into the future. If the company provides upbeat color on its e-commerce efforts and the impact of the new gaming consoles, it could make a quarterly miss more palatable.",2021-03-16 23:17:39

DD,(STORY TIME) “What is the Utilization rate for AMC?” as explained by an Ape for other Apes.,217,m6g42l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6g42l/story_time_what_is_the_utilization_rate_for_amc/,41,1615948940.0,"🎓DD for the day for the apes of all levels: (Trust me, this post is a fun one I promise. Read through! Don’t be afraid!) 

Lesson of the day: 🎓
What is the utilization rate and what is AMC’s rate? What does it mean for AMC ?🎥🍿

So Amc is currently at 84.62% according to Ortex.

In Smart Ape language : it’s number of shares borrowed by hedgies/short sellers/market makers divided by total lendable shares by other institutional lenders/hedgies. 
——-
In Smooth Ape Language (the fun begins): 

* Gorillas 🦍 = We the average retailers

* Snakes 🐍 = Hedgies 

* Lions 🦁 = Institutional Lenders that run the kingdom

*** STORY TIME***

The snakes 🐍 wanna take away the bananas from the gorillas and double, triple, 10x their own banana count.

But the snake 🐍 currently doesn’t have enough bananas in his own possession to make the strategic moves he and other snakes thought of, so he needs to borrow from someone he KNOWS has some. None other than the kingdom rulers themselves. The lions 🦁.

So the lion 🦁 says: I’ve got 100M bananas 🍌 total in my name that I’m willing to allow you to borrow. And I gave up 84.62% of them. So if you want the rest or some of my bananas, my interest has gone up because I have less availability. Might have more soon, might have less. Idk. But you snakes have been bombarding me for bananas the last 2 months. 

Snake 🐍 says “screw it, 😤 I’ll take them because my pride is too great and the gorillas are holding on to their bananas like diamond hands and its become harder to hoard them myself because they have been growing their bananas in the backyard each day. Ughhh, I even bet with other cobras and gorillas that their bananas production will go down. And its doing the opposite!!! 🐍😬 So I need to show them who’s boss!” 

Lion 🦁 says:”go for it! Here take another 15M  but i want them back.” 💸💰

**SO WHAT DO THE GORILLAS DO TO BE AHEAD OF THEM?✊**

Gorilla 🦍 says to Gorilla Kingdom: “haha, look at these 1000 smart snakes trying to out think 10 million smooth apes...i may eat crayons when im alone but when it’s me and the boys/girls we eat snakes.....! Alright boys 🦍and gorilla gals🦧, if you see other apes selling for low price. Buy!!! If not, do Nothing else but keep holding the bananas and continue to grow them in the backyard. Eventually their time will run out, there won’t be enough bananas to be passed around amongst snakes 🐍 And they’ll have lost on other tactics (options) and be forced to buy up all the bananas they promised to give back and never did because they sold them all to us. But we like our bananas ripe. And we don’t wanna give them back. Well, not unless they pay me $2008.01 per banana. So... yeah”

Fin. Thanks for reading! 

A thumbs up and share with people to spread knowledge ! 👍

Ps: Friday will be fun 🙂 LOTS of bananas going to be made available for purchase on Monday cuz if not. Snakes are gonna be tied up and Lions gonna be very mad.",2021-03-16 22:42:20

Embracer   Group is noted on the Swedish First North  exchange which is not as  regulated as ""normal"" exhanges are. There is  also not the same ruleset  for tax in most countries so be aware of this.  It is also said to be  more risky investments.

They operate in the game development and publishing business and I don't really need to dive into the prospect of this sector.

Embracer Group ([EMBRAC-B.ST](https://embrac-b.st/))   is the parent company of several development and publishing business   within the gaming industry and throughout most platforms including   mobile, console and PC.

To name a couple of well known items in their IP inventory:

* Valheim (if you don't know yet this is going to be a catalyst)
* Saints Row
* Goat Simulator

**The company**

They  operate Koch Media, Cofee Stain, Amplifier, Saber, Deca and a group  containing banned chars (similar to a ticker) as operative groups.

They hold 220+ IP's, 59 development studios, the 6 above operative groups with 5500+ people in 40+ countries.

*Strategic plans*

Grabbing from the 2019/2020 annual report page 6 highlights:

* Investment for long-term growth
* Growth through M&A
* Empowerment through decentralization (reference to several dev. and pub. branches)
* Reinvesting profit to increase growth

*Let's see what they've done about it* with referencing their press releases ([https://embracer.com/news-media/](https://embracer.com/news-media/)):

* 2021-02-03: Merge with Easybrain (Mobile games as Sudoku and so on)
* 2021-02-03: Acquires Aspyr Media (Star Wars, Sid Meier's Civilization etc.)
* 2021-02-03: Merge with Gearbox Entertainment Company (Borderlands)
* 2020-11-18: Acquires Flying Wild Hog (Shadow Warrior series)

...

Seems like they took M&A serious.. If you're interested, theres a presentation of the M&A actions here: [https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MA-update\_Feb\_3\_2021-ny.pdf](https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MA-update_Feb_3_2021-ny.pdf)

We   can't go about without mentioning Valheim. The viking survival game   that is currently running early access on Steam and had over 4 million   buys came February. The game has taken the industry with storm. As of   writing there's 18k viewers on twitch which is close to Overwatch and   Hearthstone.

It was release the 2nd of February through Steam with a 96% positive feedback.

**Financials (*****sort of*****)**

First   looking at the gaming market which has been reported from 2018 to 139   billion USD to 2019 ranging in 152 billions. Estimates for 2022 is  close  to 200 billion.

Second,  insider  holdings. The insiders account for 52.7% of the shares with  35.5% being  on institutional hands. The remainder for trade is 11.8%.

The Q4 report arrrives the 20th of May.

The report is a bit difficult for my smooth brain to compare since the previous year is for 15 months so bear with me.

Net sales grew from \~4603m SEK to \~5249m SEK.

Operational EBIT grew from \~717m SEK to \~1033m SEK.

I'm not yet that experiences in reading the financial reports so I won't bore you with my mistakes. It can be found here: [https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1298981.pdf](https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1298981.pdf)

Based on the current price, this is about a 2300% profit.  

Per his contract as a board member, he cannot own more than 20% of the company, leaving him with 7.1% company stake remaining he is able to purchase, or roughly 3,900,000 shares.

So let's say he sits and waits till this Friday, when MMs continue to move the price toward 155 (current calculated max pain price for options on 3/19).  He then files a 13F, and buy's up 3.9 million shares...this would still put his profit average well over 1000%, AND would blow MM's attempts to pin the price out of the water, triggering a gamma squeeze...this creates massive margin calls by Tuesday 3/23, which coincidentally happens to be when GME reports earnings.  The convergence of these two factors in addition to hype momentum ***could be enough*** to then trigger the MOASS imo.  Thoughts?

DD,Energy Play on deck. Halliburton - HAL - 47% move by July?,0,m6ehn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ehn4/energy_play_on_deck_halliburton_hal_47_move_by/,63,1615944720.0,"I've attached an image of WTI - Crude Oil and the Purple line is the correlation between WTI and the company HAL - Halliburton. 

About Halliburton - 

They are the largest ""services"" company for the Oil and Gas industry.  They have their greedy little fingers in every aspect of Oil and Gas all over the world.  If the price of Oil is bullish then they are making bank.  

What really caught my attention was the last 10 years when comparing the price of oil during inflationary periods and how it impacted HAL share price.  You'll notice that only after the financial crisis and during Covid, two times in which the world pretty much shut down, did HAL ever trade below (% wise) with WTI.   Obviously on this chart horizon of 10 years.  If you back out to 1996 then HAL is trading % wise over 100% lower than WTI.   

&#x200B;

With inflation pressures this will only cause WTI to continue to increase as well as if you are bullish that people will actually start traveling more.  Which is what traveling companies like Expedia are forecasting.  People have been locked up in their homes and their ready to get out and burn oil... 

Political Pressures - 

With the Biden admin hurting US based oil companies by banning fracking and production on federal land this also has caused pressure on the price of oil.  Not as many drill sites can start up as before.  Also the Keystone pipeline XL project was shut down.  Not to mention if Biden decides to start another middle east conflict.  The treasury wants the interest rate on the 10 year to be around 2.5% which would also increase oil's price.  

&#x200B;

My dumb ape brain is saying that HAL is a major play for the Covid open trade.  However, I'm a stupid moron who is just guessing and this probably will fail...

3. **UWMC pasys dividends**  (long term)
4. **Analysts are bullish on this stocks**, giving an average target price of **11,63$ / 12,40$**  (in case if u care )
5. **The company had a superb 2020 (in terms of revenue / earnigs )** and is projected to have also a superb Q1 (house market & mortage are in ""bullish"" mode )

(upvote, comment so everyone sees Apedate!)
We have seen some rising volatility the last days, which we love. But there is one very interesting fact. 

**Fact 1:** Last Friday the GME &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; AMC stocks formed a new dip, which all of us apes bought instantly. Do you remember the time the shittingers started dipping and halting the stocks? No ... WELL I DO! It was excactly 12:20 when the shitters shitstorm started shitting.


**Fact 2:** Yesterday was the same thing going on. Shitters formed an new bottom dip, for us to buy, and we love them because of that ❤️. The interesting thing here is, that the shitting and dipping and halting started at 12:20!

**Conclusion**: WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE?! Yeahh... not excatly. We would like to call it here shitter’s market manipulation.

SSR has been triggered for the last trading days, which helped us to form an strong support at 13$. Anyway let’s start with the premarket update

**Pre market Update 09:02**: Germany is proudly hodling the support line which has formed the last few days between 13.10$-13.40$. We shall aid them in 28 Minutes when the stock exhange officialy opens. 

Stocks available to short: 650.000
Current Stock Price: 13.46$

**Update 09:31:** Stock opens with 13.45$ and instanlt plumets down to 13.3$. We will have to fight at the support Line until we get some buying power rolling.

Stocks available to short: 650.000 (unchanged)
Current Price: 13.35$

Stocks available to short dropped from 1,100,000 to 650.000 which explains the dip. Buy the dip apes!

**Update 10:02:** Them Shitters used around 50.000 short stocks, that’s why we see our resistance getting tested all the time. We should be up abd running in the next 1-2 Hours. 14$ isn’t far away until than.

**Update 10:10:** We touched 12.50$ and jumped right back to our support at 13$,
I’m sure we have quite few diamond hands holding there, good job. Anyway we had some massive volume at starting 30 Minutes, around 1 Million! The way back to 14$ shouldn’t be too hard with all those stimulus checks incoming, I guess! Buy the FKN DIP until it ain’t too late! 

Current Price: 13$
Shares available to borrow: 750.000

**Update 11:03:** The dip stopped dipping. Last chance to buy some stonks. No seriously, we shall see some upward movement from here (12.74$). AMC is very likely gonna follow GME (which madd +10% in like 10 Minutes 🚀). 
Anyway there is also bad news which actually is good news: The shitters have topped up their “borrowable-shares” it’s sitting right now at 4.600.000 !!!! ... They could short the fuck out of us now and i would Love if that happens, because than .... THAN THEY WILL LOSE EVEN MORE MONEY once the 🚀 starts off to the 🌚 

Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000
Current stock price: 12.94$

**Update 11:12:** Im gonna predict something. Today at exactly some seconds before 12:20, we will see a massive Stonk Sell-Off from the Shitters, they will try and implement fear into us, but they won’t succeed.

Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000
Current price: 13.13$ &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;— is the stock price trying to tell us something? ... 13k13 which means 13.130!!!

**Update 12:03**
1.5 Million NEW shorts available which means there are now 6.100.000 Shorts available to the HFuckers. Wow, that’s gonna be a bloodbath in some days, be ready for Impact any day and show them what diamond hands are made from. 
Our support line moves diagonally down which means, it is not anymore at 13, but moved rather down to 12.4-12.6$. As long as we dont lose that 
Support today we should see some upward movement ... if HFuckers dont manipulate the market at 12:20 like yesterday.

Currently available shorts: 6.100.000 ... seriously.
Current Price: 12.69 (well ... at this point you should tell your wifes boyfriend that amc said its 69 time)

**Update 12:08**
The short borrowing Fee has massively decreased. It was 3 working days ago at 8%, now it is sitting at 1.8%. This is only embracing the fact that they are scared from our diamond hands and are preparing the next market manipulation.

**Update 12:20**
HedgieFuzzers have decided to not launch they’re massive attack Today. They are probably stocking their positions up. But i’m sure we will see the attack in the next days (Before we can see again daily profits of 30-50%)

Shorts available: 6.100.000
Current price: 12.50$

**Update 12:21**
What is interesting here is, is the stock dynamic which upped the AMC price from 12.5$ up to 12.75 in under 2 Minutes.

Shorts available: 6.100.000 ... Fee changed from 1.8% to 1.7%
Current Price: 12.75

**Update 13:01**
AMC is slowly refuelling it’s motors and starting to scratch at 12.83 resistance. If we get rejected from this resistance , than an double top scenario could occur, which would push the price as low as to 12.50 (where also our support is). Time will tell.
Besides that not much has happened.

Shorts available: 6.100.000
Current price: 12.8$

**Update 13:05**
It seems that we will break the 12.83$ resistance. Keep up diamond habds and buy the dip!
We also have an inversed head &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; shoulders to assist us in the push to 13$. 

**Update 13:55**
We have barricaded ourselves at 13$ and aren’t planning on giving that mark away to the hedgies! 
The next mark is around 13.6-14$. 
Anyway i have discovered something very mysterious. The available short stocks has decreased by 100.000. From 6.1mil to 6.0mil. Apes, all of you know what that means ... \*apes nodding their head\*
... and if not ill tell you ... \*apes breathe eases\*.
This means the HedgeFuckers are preparing to decrease the stock price again, with my prediction being an mix between closing long positions and short attacking (SSR is enabled so this won’t be very successfull, unless they manipulate the market again.). We should see attacks dropping the amc stock, when it starts scratching 14.10$.

Shorts available currently: 6.000.000
Price Currently: 13.15

**Update 14:18**
Still very quiet. Amc is preparing for the fight with resistance at 13.5-13.6$, once we break it we shall have a smooth ride to 14$.

Shorts available: 6.1mil
Current Price: 13.3$

**Update 14:30** 
Shitters are making their moves again. See how the stock dropped 0.40$ unnormaly while being in an natural up movement supported by double buttom + inversed head ans shoulders and some 🦍 Ape checks (stimulus). We should drop im the next minutes to 12.8$-12.9$ before our rocket refules for taking on the 14$ mark. 

Shorts available: 6.1mil
Price: 13.02$

**Update: 14:52**
Apparently we have failed the double bottom + inversed head and shoulders climb. But domething even better is coming up: rising wedge and the 5th leg are those 12.8$ where we are hovering right now. The 6th leg could catapult us to 14$! 

Current Price: hovering at 12.8$ and building up 5th leg

**Update 14:57**
Quick uodate on shorts available. The shitteres decreased available shorts by 200.000! Watch out for some massive barrier at 14$ or maybe even at 13.4$
Did they allready use those 200.000 shorts? Probably not, but they reserved them so to say.

**Update Hoodie** So i have been trying to guess some coupon codes on that shop below and it seems as they have made an *Easter egg** with the hidden code: **diamondhands**
It will give you an discount if you order something
Don’t believe me? Go and try it 🦍🚀

Warning: I hope my boss doesn’t ask me why i am taking regular shits every 1 hour ... 🚀

**And I’m making an giveaway for BUY THE FKN DIP!** ... APES since we are currently in a dip i will gift [this Hoodie](https://apemerch.com/product/buy-the-fkn-dip-hoodie) to one comment  if AMC reaches 16$ EOD! Cause i fkin love the stonk and made allready double my initial investment back! 🚀🥵

DD,Cleveland Cliffs DD $CLF,22,m6djow,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6djow/cleveland_cliffs_dd_clf/,33,1615942329.0,"Disclaimer: Not a financial adviser of financial advice.

Cleveland Cliffs is a one of the largest vertically integrated iron ore companies in the US. This means that they own the mines, blast furnaces etc. 

Bull Case:

Over the summer China introduced a new infrastructure stimulus plan in an attempt to recover from the pandemic. This caused steel prices to skyrocket past pre covid levels.

[Steel Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/819cwtmx3fn61.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=a76b8d5fd09d063638758f97faae988593f79419)

Most of the steel they used would be from Chinese manufacturers but this has eaten into the global steel supply raising prices everywhere.

Now US president Joe Biden plans on unveiling a US infrastructure stimulus bill. Potential as large as $2 trillion says Goldman Sachs ([link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/03/01/bidens-infrastructure-bill-could-be-2-trillion-behemoth-heres-what-goldman-sachs-is-expecting/?sh=aa7565f6071e)). Biden has also introduced a buy American mandate for government projects. As one of the largest steel producers in America I think CLF stands to benefit enormously from this and with steel prices already above pre covid levels I think we could see a large increase in profit for CLF.

CLF uses blast furnaces which although less efficient than EAF furnaces they are better when the steel market as at highs because they can produce way more. 

Although I am not really a fan of analyst ratings is $19.50 for the stock which is a 16% increase from its current levels.

Bear Case:

CLF has embarked on a large expansion through multiple acquisitions. This has allowed it to become a vertically integrated but as also come with a large price tag.

Currently because of this they have $5.85 billion in long term debt which is substantial especially if steel prices fall off.

Balance Sheet: ([link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLF/financials/annual/balance-sheet))

Conclusion:

I am bullish on this stock and currently have only 10 shares and I intend to buy more.",2021-03-16 20:52:09

I haven't been posting. I lurk on Reddit. I don't post. I do read, however, despite having the comprehension of an ape. The content I've been consuming - the personal stories, the wrinkled-brain analysis, the memes - has been amazing. This truly is a unique community - it's global, inclusive, and (by and large) supportive. It's a great resource for those, like myself, who have jumped into the market with little understanding. GameStop piqued my interest. This community has helped refine that interest into understanding...well, maybe just an interest in one day understanding at least some of what's going on. So, as an ape who has been lurking and learning, I thank all you apes -- from Cornelius to Zaius, from Grodd to Solovar, and of course King Kong himself, DFV -- you apes run the spectrum, and are on the spectrum. You've helped me, the ape from 2001: A Space Odyssey (I think it's an ape, though maybe a neanderthal - apes can't remember details from films), gather my first investment tools. 

On a related note, I put my retirement account into GME. Pretty high cost basis? No. Not considering what's going to happen in the near future. It's gonna be bananas.

Apes.  Listen up.  The world is slowly emerging from this pandemic.  China is largely out of it.  America is coming out of it.  Everyone in America who wants a vaccination will be able to get one by this summer, maybe sooner.  Travel restrictions are going to be lifted.  You know what's going to happen?  People are going to lose their motherfucking minds and they are going to take all that unused vacation and $GME money and TRAVEL!  

The pandemic crushed oil.  $GUSH went from $1462 a share on Dec. 1, 2019 to $15.66 a share on March 1, 2020.  The world shut down.  Travel stopped.  No cruises, few flights, people cooped up in their houses.  The price crashed and the oil companies started closing wells and could not move product.  If you're like me, you filled up your car once in the March 20 - June 20 timeframe.

When the world fully emerges from this pandemic people are going to travel.  See family.  Just get away.  People are saving money, a lot of money.  People are saving vacation time, a lot vacation time.  People are going to fly, cruise, drive, all over the world and the oil companies are not going to ramp up production (on purpose) fast enough which will create supply issues while demand is sky high which will push the price sky high and the oil companies will use that to try and recoup losses they suffered during the pandemic before political pressure builds to the point where they have to increase production and get price down.  This will be especially true for places like Russia where their economy really depends on oil.  Obviously the OPEC countries in the Middle East too.

$GUSH is going to rocket with all that demand.  Does it get back to $1462 a share or higher?  Maybe.  However, what if it only gets back to $500 a share but you bought it today at $81.50 a share?  Still a pretty nice payday.  Only recovers to $250 a share?  Still doing good.  Buy $GUSH.

 Buy the fucking dip and dont make the same mistake that i did when i didnt buy the $48 per share GME cuz i got afraid that i would lose more. WSB is not a place for people who gets scared when the board turns RED.

We know that they know that we know that they are really fucked and desperate for the MOASS is about to come. Lets just chill, sit back, and relax.

Below is a slide taken directly from GoPro's most recent quarterly Q4 2020 Preliminary Earnings Results Summary.  ([Source](https://s21.q4cdn.com/291350743/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-2020-Supplemental-Slides.pdf))

Subscriptions have increased 145% YoY, and the most recent quarterly growth was 52%.  And all of this was during the pandemic.  What do you think will happen once we exit the pandemic and more people start traveling and exploring over the summer?  It will continue to grow.

So how much revenue is being pulled in with subscriptions?  Below is an excerpt from a GoPro news article explaining the subscription growth after the release of the HERO9 Black.  ([Source](https://gopro.com/en/us/news/hero9-black-accelerates-gopro-subscriber-count))

>*“GoPro.com has seen substantial year-over-year sales growth during the post-launch period across all regions, globally,” said Woodman. “Demand for HERO9 Black and the GoPro subscription at GoPro.com are accelerating our shift to a more direct-to-consumer business.”*  
>  
>*The GoPro subscription is available at* *GoPro.com* *for $49.99 annually, $4.99 a month, and can also be purchased in a bundle with GoPro’s new flagship camera, HERO9 Black, for $349.98* *exclusively at GoPro.com*\*.\*

With approximately 750,000 paying subscriptions, and assuming they are going at the cheapest amount of $49.99 annually, that makes current revenue from subscriptions alone $37,492,500 annually, or $3,124,375 quarterly. Factor in the estimated growth over the next year, GoPro could potentially pull in **$91 million** from just subscriptions alone.

Edit: At approx 11 AM, GoPro  announced a new mobile app, Quick. ([source](https://gopro.com/en/us/news/gopro-launches-premium-mobile-app-quik))

DD,Corsair $CRSR DD - Double Your Investment Safely!,108,m6a1cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6a1cq/corsair_crsr_dd_double_your_investment_safely/,73,1615932958.0,"Position 1: https://imgur.com/a/GlUVtqT    
Position 2: 4/16, 5/21, 8/20 calls  

Corsair $CRSR makes high end PC peripherals and other pc/gaming parts. They are also making a huge push to capture revenue from content creators, which has a much higher margin. They are quickly becoming a major player in the industry. Everyone knows their name, their brand is slowly capturing market space in other sectors. A good article on this can be found online, search for ""Corsair gaming moving from player to contender""  

The stock was very much cyclical, +/- 20% ever couple weeks, with growing support and a bullish trend. Well, after a bottom the Nasdaq sell-off began and so did the $35 support of Corsair, crashing to the 20's for one day.

The financials of Corsair are amazing for a growth tech company. Seriously, find me one tech company that grew 70% YOY in revenue and is valued at a forward P/E of low 20's. Currently, they're trading at 2x revenue. That is insane, however, it's because their margins are lower as they don't manufacture most of their own products.

My favorite part of Corsair? They're buying up companies in which many are related to streaming and recurring revenue. Look at some of them:

Elgato (They are 100% focused on making products for content creators)  
SCUF (A streamer will want to showoff their custom controller and expect them to own more than just one)  
ORIGIN PC (Same as above. Showing off custom built products as a content creator)  
GAMER SENSEI (A coaching platform for gamers)  

Their Growth Strategy is as follows:
-Advance as the global leader in high-performance gaming and streaming gear.  
-Continue to develop innovative, market-leading gaming and streaming gear.  
-Expand into new gear and services that grow our market opportunity.  
-Leverage our software platforms to sell more gear to existing customers.  
-Strengthen relationships with end-users by increasing direct-to-consumer sales.  

Then there's the 3/22 lockup expiry. During a 3/12 investor conference the CEO Andy Paul (who I hope they replace, he's a tech nerd not a multi-billion dollar company CEO), stated there is nothing to worry about for the lockup expiry. They went with one investor who is not selling their shares. For the other 7 million+ shares they sold in January during a second public offering, they were purchased at $35! Do you think these investors will immediately start selling? If they do, it's two days of volume. It won't be an issue. Meanwhile, everyone is suggesting they'll buy AFTER lockup! By then, it will be too late. 

Finally, the short float is extremely high. Two things happen during lockup expiry. One, investors sell and the prices go down 10%-20%, and the shorts cover. Two, prices do not go down, shorts cover, shooting the price up 10%-20%.

This just in: They released a new keyboard and it's already sold out. Their products are on FIRE!

Bear Thesis:
-Gaming was a COVID play and will not grow in 2021.  
-Lockup Expiry 3/22 increases shares float.  
-Tech stocks are scary.  
-Low support levels as it crossed below MACD.  
-Earnings are low. They need to increase their margins.  

All of bear points are mute when Corsair continues to blow revenue expectations

TLDR: Corsair is a great long-term play. If you believe gaming to continue to grow and Corsair products to be great, it's a no-brainer. My EOY price target is $67  

edit: I would like to mention, I believe other companies in this sector are good plays, like LOGI. However, Corsair is a smaller company and has more room to rocket.",2021-03-16 18:15:58

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-16-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&P 500 closed at record highs again

> * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month’s record high close.

> * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

*****

> # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

> * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government’s February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed’s extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation’s central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

*****

> # 3. Moderna studies Covid vaccine in kids; more countries halt AstraZeneca

> * Moderna has started testing its Covid vaccine in children ranging in age from six months to less than 12 years old. The mid-to-late stage study intends to enroll about 6,750 kids in the U.S. and Canada. In a separate study, which began in December, Moderna is also testing its vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years old. The two-shot vaccine has already been authorized for emergency use in Americans 18 and older.

> * Sweden and Latvia on Tuesday joined a fast-growing list of European nations suspending use of AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine as health regulators proceed with a new review into its side effects after reports of blood clots. Germany, France, Italy and Spain on Monday said they would all stop administering it. However, the World Health Organization and Europe’s drug regulator have recommended that countries continue to use AstraZeneca’s two-shot regimen.

*****

> # 4. Regulators investigating ‘violent’ Tesla crash; Autopilot not ruled out yet

> * The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating what it calls “violent” crash involving a Tesla sedan and a tractor trailer last week in Detroit. Authorities have not yet said whether the electric car maker’s Autopilot, Full Self-Driving or FSD beta may have contributed to the accident. The NHTSA has previously embarked on probes into more than a dozen crashes that were thought to involve Tesla’s advanced driver assist systems.

*****

> # 5. OxyContin maker Purdue proposes $10 billion plan to exit bankruptcy

> * OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is proposing a $10 billion plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Those efforts would include a significant boost, more than $4 billion, from members of the Sackler family who own the Connecticut-based company. Court documents show Purdue officials continued to push to maintain sales of OxyContin even as it became clear the drug was being abused. Complicated litigation is playing out in courts across the country in efforts to hold the drug industry accountable for the nation’s opioid crisis.

DD,Scorpio Tankers ($STNG) could be going to the Moon for Actual Good Economic Reasons!,46,m67n2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m67n2b/scorpio_tankers_stng_could_be_going_to_the_moon/,27,1615925498.0,"There is potential for a short-squeeze emerging in a stock a that I have been  following for over a year now and I feel like it just fits this crowd  and theme so well that I couldnt resist sharing.

Stock is Scorpio Tankers $STNG. It  has been all over the place for the last year, but is finally catching  its bid due to a real fundamental shift in the market for clean product  tankers and it has a pretty sizable short interest that will need to be  covered over the next week....

For  some brief background: Scorpio owns a bunch of super huge ships (like  the size of the eiffel tower and shit) that only transport clean refined  products (gasoline, diesel, etc) and other specialty oils and chemicals  (like palm oil, old bacon grease for bio-diesel, etc). Now, since it  got cold AF up in TX a few weeks back, US refineries have been offline  and we have been importing a bunch of gasoline, diesel, etc from Europe  (if you noticed how expensive gas is everywhere... there ya go). The  catch? The damage to refineries from busted pipes and downed power  sources was WAY WORSE than anyone expected and instead of a bump in the  road, we have a situation that is actually worse then Katrina in terms  of refined product availability. The result? We are puling a shit-ton of  fuel from Europe (where they were drowning in it) to the point that  they have now drained the Middle East, who is now draining Asia.  Needless to say... its crazy. Not headline news because... you know, its  the news, but if you start digging through reliable energy resources,  you can see how bad the situation really is (just a note, they still  havent got the refineries back online). To make the situation a bit  worse, the world is opening up faster than anyone expected and we are  using a shit load of refined products (everything from gasoline to  plastic) and its creating massive strain on the refining sector.

Speaking  of the refining sector, lets pause there for a sec. Due to how bad the  decline in demand for refined products was last year, OECD countries  decided to convert \~4Mbpd of refining capacity into import terminals  because it was cheaper to ship finished gasoline and diesel into most  countries than to bother with importing crude and refining it at home.  Australia was probably the best example, but it happened across the  globe in Europe, US, Japan, etc.

The  result? Everyone is now scrambling to try to import gasoline, diesel,  heating oil, and other refined products all over the world. Similar to  how these industries completely kill themselves for a decade by everyone  across the globe building capacity at the same time and oversupplying  the market; COVID caused this to happen in reverse! So, while the entire  refining landscape shifts over the next few years/decades, the  incredibly lucky winners will be the guys that happen to own the ships  that transport refined products all over the world. Enter Tankers.

Now  not all tankers are equal. First, there are crude tankers and product  tankers. As their name suggests, crude tankers carry crude oil and  product tankers carry refined products. They never cross paths, they are  completely their own markets. Ignoring the more complicated issue of  what will happen with crude tankers, lets take the more obvious play of  product tankers. With the current market going crazy due to the global  inventory imbalances due to the US refinery issues from the TX freeze,  product tankers are getting bid up as traders and oil majors are  desperate to get gasoline, jet, diesel, etc from Asia to the Western  Hemisphere... rates are surging and wont stop anytime soon. Add in the  rolling conversions of refinery capacity to import terminals and  biofhuel mixing operaitons, and you have a set-up that is just so wall  timed and placed for this specific sector, it feels honestly dirty to be  benefiting from the terrible shit that the folks in TX had to endure  with the freeze.

Finally for the  supply side. Product tanker owners - and tanker owners in general - have  stopped ordering new vessels over the past 5 years for a few reasons:  1) rates have sucked and it doesnt make sense, 2) banks have been burned  a few too many times and financing has dried up, 3) their regulator  has promised a set of carbon-related regulations that will drive  the decision for the next-gen of propusion technology, but they havent  delivered the regs and the propulsion technology is changing just about  daily so no one is ordering, and 4) the shipyards got crushed in COVID  and consolidated operations, followed by an insane rate boom in dry buly  and containers that subsequently took up shipyard capacity for the  forseeable future, you couldn't add a meaningful amount of capacity to  the product tanker market even if you cleared hurdles 1-3 due to  capacity. A small nuance: product tankers differ from crude tankers  primarily due tot he coating on their tanks that protects the more  volatile refined products from degradation during transport (pretty  important if you consider things like jet fuel); now those coatings  deteriorate over time and are deemed unreliable at \~15yrs. So whether or  not an owner decides to ""scrap"" his ship, nobody is gonna give him/her  any business for the traditional/premium product trade. A bit of  history: the product tanker trade really emerged in the late 1990s and  early 2000s, with a huge building boom taking place in that period as we  as a society began to trade refined products more heavily and  understand the importance of quality control in a more scientific  manner. Now, in 2020, we are seeing a huge portion of the existing fleet  ""age-out"".

Very long story short; The world will need a lot more product tankers in the near-term, and today, they just aren't there.

Now, Finally, why this is important in the context of a short squeeze in the near future.

The  largest operator of product tankers in the world is Scorpio Tankers  (NYSD: STNG). They have proven themselves strong operators and also have  (to a meaningful extent) created a consolidated position the LR2  segment where they are the largest single owner and also manage a huge  fleet of other owners' ships in what is called a pool. LR2s are the  largest product tankers, and given the market dynamics I described  above, they are in very high demand. Rates are rising quickly and dont  seem to have a good reason to stop. To make matters a bit more  interesting, Scorpio has a rather large debt load, making it the target  of short sellers. It is currently the most shorted tanker stock despite  having the youngest fleet with deepest scrubber penetration (discussed  below). After months of being pounded in 2020, the stock is finally  ripping upwards, and with the earnings potential of its fleet it should  easily double or triple on sheer fundamentals. Now, enter a few fun  freebees that make this fun: a related party to the Company, Scorpio  Services Holdings (or something), which is owned by management is  purchasing millions of dollars of stock roughly every 6 wks, along with  Scorpio's President, Robert Bugnee, who along with personal stock  purchases has purchased millions of dollars worth of out of the money  call options expiring from here to 2023. To put it lightly, they have  backed up the truck. The Board has also approved a $250M share buyback  program (market cap is \~$1B) and at Bugbees prior shipping venture he  bought back \~30% of all outstanding stock before selling the company at  the market peak for an absurd return to shareholders.

My final points on the company are on its fleet:

1. Scorpio  has the largest fleet of Long-Range (LR) vessels in the world: With the  closure of OECD refineries and global refining capacity shifting to  China, India, and the Middle East, voyage distances will increase  significantly making demand for LRs even stronger.
2. Scorpio  has the youngest fleet (Period): With the importance of e.s.g. and  customers need to track carbon output, combined with EEXI regulations  (google) from IMO and the EUs decision to add shipping into the carbon  cap-and-trade market, yonger/e.c.o. tonnage will dominate the tanker market  going forward. Over the past months, large charterers such as Trafigura  have instituted CO2 tracking and reporting policies that create a  pricing premium for ECO vessels like Scorpios. Also, Scorpio has already  begun to see revenues from generating carbon credits during Q4'20 due  to its ECO fleet; if Tesla has taught us anything: those can be  valuable.
3. Scrubbers:  Scorpio has been the most aggressive product tanker owner in installing  (expensive) exhaust scrubbers to reduce SOx emissions. This also allows  them to burn traditional bunker fuels rather than the new ""Very Low  Sulfer Fuel Oil"" or V.L.S.F.O., which has caused its competitors incredible  headaches. 1) V.L.S.F.O. is a new fuel and has not been delivered in with  consistent make-ups (they started experimenting with mixing jet fuel  into the blend when nobody was flying) which has caused extensive and  severe mechanical issues and engine failures. Additionally, the pricing  difference between V.L.S.F.O. and the fuel Scorpio is able to use in  combination with its scrubbers has been rapidly increasing and expected  to remain elevated, providing a SIGNIFICANT cost advantage to Scorpio.
4. Management  has used a lot of debt to build and support this incredible fleet, and  they have managed their balance sheet about as well as could be dreamed.  They have been able to maintain strong liquidity and continue to  refinance/roll their secured debt and push out maturities. They also  have avoided any real restrictive covenants, allowing them to return  cash to shareholders despite what seems like a hefty debt load. Note,  this is part of investing in cyclical industrial businesses... they  require capital, but when they hit the cycle right the cash flows are  unbelievable.
5. Finally,  the short squeeze. Scorpio has been heavily shorted for over a year due  to its debt load and a general pessimistic view on global oil  consumption (recall that even if consumption remained depressed,  refinery closures would create significant demand for product tankers  beyond current capacity). The market has finally turned - aided by the  freeze in TX - and the shorts have begun to cover, but there remains  over 2 days of volume sold short and with the brutal price action over  the past year along with managements large purchases, there could be a  real group of diamond hands that can create a real squeeze next week as  the remaining shorts look to cover.

This is both a trade and an investment. The squeeze could happen over the  next week or two; the signal form the underlying rates market along  with the strong price action will have the shorts looking to exit, its  just a matter of who will be selling (not me)? In the longer term, this  will be a multi-year cycle with multi-bagger potential for those who are  strong enough to just hold..

Note: the research for this DD has mostly been made by u/TendiesOnlyPls over at r/TankerGang. I am very convinced by the arguments (and bought some april calls so far but plan on buying more) and have decided (with his permission) to share this with you all here on wsb. As usual, do your own research before you invest money, but imo this seems like a solid bet, and could be a nice hedge for a tech heavy portfolio.

# Financial Disclaimer

* This is definitely not financial advice, the associated volatility and risk is much more substantial than your average trade. Precede with caution!

&#x200B;

# Intro

* My fellow apes, did you miss your ticket to the moon/ still holding your ticket to mars with GME? Well here is a brand new prospective outlook that I have put some thought into. This aint no ticket to mars thou, RIOT is a possible fucking ticket to Uranus (the furtherst we could possibly go).

&#x200B;

* Over the past few weeks I have been critically reflecting and decided to pen down my thoughts on a prospective for a long term stock outlook for RIOT. And as the underlying asset value drops temporarily I see this as a great dip buy potential with major upside prospects.

&#x200B;

# Current Economic Climate

* With Biden signing the 1.9 Trillion USD Covid relief into law, an estimated 17 million people will receive $1400 USD as their discretionary income. With the meme-fication of the stock market, investment has gained traction among the younger generations of millennials and gen z. Reports predict that most of COVID relief checks will contribute to rent and essentials, but a growing proportion of the population will use this ‘free discretionary income’ to put into the stock market.

&#x200B;

* Linking this to Riot, Raconteur research infographic has demonstrated that it is the newer generations that are most interested and most likely to get into alternative decentralized sources of asset diversification investments. With Riot’s earnings report releasing on March 31st that works in conjunction with all these events, the potential for a spike and parabolic move could be significant.

&#x200B;

* In terms of a longer outlook on the asset that RIOT procures and sell, the influx of big institutional buyers and interests (MicroStrategy, Tesla, Galaxy Digital Holdings, Ruffer Investment company, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan) has solidified alternative assets as a ‘holdable-asset’ and a far better hedge for inflation relative to gold. Either for long-term capital growth, or an inflationary hedging asset (with a faster than expected rebound of the global economy, interest rate and inflationary increase is a major concern for institutional players).

&#x200B;

* In particular, JPMorgan has recently issued a prospectus investment debt instrument that introduces proxy stocks to this aforementioned trend, where riot will constitute 15% of the portfolio and will continue to introduce more institution money into the picture, amplifying the returns of RIOT over the coming years.

&#x200B;

# RIOT an “unprofessional” Technical Analysis

* So we know based on a statistical analysis over the past 2 years that RIOT has over a 90% correlation to the underlying asset it procures and sells. However RIOT has 3X relative volatility to its underlying asset it procures and sells. - To simply put - say RIOT’s underlying assets increase by 5% in its market value, RIOT which procures and sells this asset increases is expected to increase by 15% - which is 3 times relative more to its underlying asset. Why is this the case? Simply put RIOT has a much smaller mkt cap compared to its underlying asset driver therefore it takes less cash inflow to increase the share price and cause possible parabolic upside swings.

&#x200B;

* With this in mind, I will now focus on a more technical side, examining RIOT’s price action behavior.

&#x200B;

* Elliott Wave Analysis - “The Elliott Wave Principle posits that collective investor psychology, or crowd psychology, moves between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences. These mood swings create patterns evidenced in the price movements of markets at every degree of trend or time scale.” - Straight from Wikipedia

&#x200B;

* Typically there are 5 Elliot waves before a slight correction. As illustrated in the diagram we have just entered wave 5! This means we can expect a bullish momentum in the market up to the possible price target of 230.48 which historically is the key -2.0 fib extension level. But hey if you get them diamonds hands the sky's the limit and the upside potential is as high as ur diamonds hands can hold.

&#x200B;

* Fibonacci Retracement - The Fib levels are key areas of support and resistance. The start of the 5th Elliot wave was propagated by a retracement of the 0.618 Key Fibonacci resistance level in confluence with large institutions ( i.e Tesla - Elon Musk) buying the main underlying asset that RIOT procures and sells. Papa Elon bless thy gains.

&#x200B;

* The recent onboarding on large institutions including banks such as JP Morgan offering debt instruments which constitute 15% RIOT stock diversification for this new trend further allows boomers to diversify into such stocks, creating a long term demand and driving up prices of RIOT in a possible parabolic manner over the upcoming year.

&#x200B;

# RIOT, shit is getting serious, the setup

* It can't be stressed enough, but just think of this RIOT play on a macro physiological level. We have the largest of the largest companies and institutions buying into a limited supply of the asset RIOT procures and sells. We have boomers slowing turning over and buying into RIOT through Big Banks such as JP Morgan's novel debt instruments. We have retail investors - the diamond hands GME bag holders with a Hella of a strong APE mentality. And RIOT the fucking company which mines and sells this underlying asset at the forefront of all this potential upside gains. RIOT has nothing to lose from this trend, only positive prospects.

&#x200B;

* Think about this fucking insane unprecedented surge in the demand of RIOTS underlying asset which is limited in supply. Guess what happens next where this massive influx of demand meets this limited supply for an asset? A fucking possible insane parabolic move upwards. And RIOT the most prominent company for this trend has insane relative stock volatility. RIOT is possibly going to the moon guys are you hopping on that ride? LMK if my analysis is trash but I firmly believe we are standing at the crossroads of history which side are you taking?

&#x200B;

# Competitors and why RIOT is remains king

* So now you are asking yourself is RIOT the better stock correlation play to this underlying asset? Personally based on my due diligence I lean towards RIOT for the following reasons. The other main competitor has seen to have high compensation packages, 2 share dilutions in a span of several months - while they have the largest expansions their ongoing costs are astronomical, their increase in cost % was larger than their increase in rev%.

&#x200B;

* The other main competitor while having the potential to have the largest operation in my opinion is just too risky (this is in my uneducated financial opinion).

&#x200B;

* RIOT on the other hand, has stronger fundamentals with strong leadership, the number of share dilutions is only one at a much smaller mkt cap indicating that they clearly value shareholder wealth perseverance more than the other main competitor, as they do not relays heavily on equity financing at the expense of shareholders as much as the other main competitor does.

&#x200B;

* RIOT looks like the more sturdy Rocketship that would get you from earth to the moon and then fucking mars possibly. A year from now when we possibly see RIOT worth over $1000 per share then we can look back and remember our fallen GME, AMC, NOK and BB brothers and tell them hey we fucking made it.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion, RIOT to the moon?

* Stay strong fellow apes and always remember “we can remain retarded longer than shorts (trend naysayers) can remain solvent”. We like the stock plain and simple, RIOT to the fucking moon?

&#x200B;

* Just a reminder, this is purely for entertainment purposes, this is very much so an unprofessional financial perspective and outlook on RIOT, do your own due diligence, never invest more money than you are willing/ able to lose for anything you see on this subreddit. Good luck guys.",2021-03-16 14:15:07

Hopefully you can ready while taking a dump. This version will also be PG, so it will be a little easier to read without all that fuck's and shits :\\

**Producer Prices Index** **(PPI) & Consumer Prices Index (CPI)**

This time I'm going to be comparing the PPI and the CPI to get an idea of how inflation could look in the next year or so. From a business standpoint, the PPI can be used to estimate input costs (especially commodities) for production, while the CPI can be used to estimate the output prices for consumers. 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppi.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppi.asp)

Also, to be specific on the CPI I'm comparing the general one, which includes consumer discretionary goods (you know, lambos and yachts), whereas Core CPI tracks essential good prices, like groceries, gas, etc. (the stuff everyone needs to live). 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp)

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coreinflation.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coreinflation.asp)

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=C2m7 ](https://preview.redd.it/lerd1tho5cn61.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=578a4006c436aa811c23532c4fb89f75dba72450)

As you can see, both lines tend to move with one another, but the PPI tends to be more erratic than the CPI. If we go back to 2008, we can see that the PPI sky-rocketed (probably due to companies going bust and inflation speculation), yet the CPI didn't budge a whole lot. This means that producers had to pay extra money for production, but they couldn't raise prices all that much on consumers. So that means, companies were *eating profits to keep doing business.* 

For example, I'm a widget maker and I can typically sell my widgets for $5 and competition is fierce! However, the plastic prices for my widgets went up by $0.25/widget.  If can try to  raise prices to $5.25, but I know my customers will buy from someone else. Instead, I'll find other places to cut prices, like buying different plastics, getting more efficient machines or letting go of workers. Don't you touch my annual bonus though! 

While commodity prices are climbing, it almost looks like business as usual the PPI. My worry is that the CPI won't keep up with the PPI. And just think about it for a minute, why would we be getting stimmy checks? So we consumers can help support these higher PPI movements.

**TLDR:** Consumers will avoid hyper-inflated products, unless they're necessities (Core CPI items). If consumers won't buy expensive products, companies can a) eat profits until conditions get better b) discontinue products until conditions get better c) go out of business because they can't sell products any further. **Therefore it's retarded to assume hyper-inflated commodities will always lead to hyper-inflated consumer goods (CPI).**

P.S. I'll try and go over more stuff on Bond yields and the SLR rule tomorrow before JPow speaks. No promises though.

Also comparing charts on Flowtrade. Looking at today we saw a down turn in the big banks in the morning to mid-day and a small recovery at end of day. This is a theory right now, but GME has significant shares held in Eee Tee Effs. In there the largest owners are you guessed it big banks. This may be correlation at best and not causation. I'd love for someone to poke holes in the data. It's still a work in progress and I update as often as I can. I've tried to gather as much applicable data about GME exposure as possible.

""I hope this is considered worthwhile to not ban me; please be kind WSB mods. I think this is a good talking point. ""

Buying the dip to average down when affordable is definitely the way, but there are circumstances where some movement in the opposite direction in regards to average price is not overly detrimental

Someone was talking about having learned the way of averaging down today in the discussion thread. I'm actually doing the opposite unfortunately with my GME. I bought in on the back side of the 2nd ""crash"" at a few times for an average **$75.55 a share** for 9 shares.

\-------------------------

I've been buying fractionally when sensible and I'm sitting on 9.39 Shares now. in the process though my average has gone to $**85.8546 a share** ( a $6.01 change over 0.4 shares of fractional pickups. (These pickups have been the daily dips)

&#x200B;

Averaging down when you are strongly out of the money is in my opinion one of the most important aspects in the WSB ""strategy"" of buying dips , holding long, and locking in the lowest average possible.

GME and this short situation makes this one of those situations w*here every share and every bit of a fractional share are going to skyrocket,* so in this case quantity at a reasonable risk and entry point **is my priority.**

I'm adding a snip from my fidelity - there's AMC and AAL below that & 1 share of GME on Robinhood back when it was 80 bucks. ( i know i know) Robinhood is bad, no doubt, BUT The wife is handling robin hood. Its  smaller stakes but she is doing a good job & to me rationalizes still using the platform until i can get her to fidelity

That's why the fidelity account became our trading platform for main investments, Robinhood for light (math based - non-centralized) ( to avoid the C word) investment and more long term holdings.  Also we have 500ish working in stash just as a long term holding.

Thank you to everyone in the WSB community for your information, analysis and conversation.

As a matter of disclosure {ill honestly sell 2 shares when the second fractal tops out around 1200 to recoup my investment (actually covers across all my trading platforms)} & THE REST IS FUEL FOR THE ROCKET TO MARS.

&#x200B;

I am diamond hand to the moon, but I want the wife to have a confident feeling out of investing with proper Due Diligence, and seeing real returns. I hope to have fractional bought 2.0 more full shares in the mean time so I don't have to touch my main shares.

TLDR: So to summarize while it is usually optimal to try to get your average cost per share down, sometimes a rise in that number is inevitable if you got in early enough. Don't be afraid of a reasonable change in your price per share if quantity is your main asperation

Avg per share was 75.55 for 9 ( buying fractionally it has increased to 81.56 for the gain of .39 shares)

The sterile wrap is important, it’s mainly used in operating theatres to wrap up surgical instruments. Theatres are by a huge mile the money making part of a hospital. My hospitals stock will run out in two weeks, a nearby hospital has already nearly ran out and is restricting category 3 surgeries(non emergency & elective things). Which is where a huge amount of money comes from. 

It’s going to force a lot of hospitals to look at other options, like rigid sterile containers which are reusable. A company called Aesculap makes these things, and they’re used globally too. 

Anyone heard of this? Or looking into how to make money from this? 

Multigate and Hayard are the companies I know that sell sterile wrap. 

Or as the anaesthetist said “guess we will be buying a lot of antibiotics” should we be buying those too?

Discussion,The power of budget reconciliation and what that means for markets (and how it could bring surprises),29,m60lky,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m60lky/the_power_of_budget_reconciliation_and_what_that/,9,1615896352.0,"**What is budget reconciliation?**

* Budget reconciliation hasn’t been used much until around the last decade, but as bipartisanship has waned to the extreme it has become the primary way to get policy done through the powers of the Senate and their exclusive control of spending/taxes. The House must also sign on. 

* BR can only happen once every fiscal year and cannot increase the budget deficit by a certain amount and so it’s limited. Because the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was the BR used by the previous administration for FY 2020, Biden has 2021 (which he’s just used) and 2022 (which he will use this year) and 2023 which he can use before the Senate and/or House could potentially change hands.

* Most importantly, BR requires a simple Senate majority.

**Why does budget reconciliation matter now?**

* Besides a response to extreme crises like the Great Recession and the pandemic which forced the two parties to work together, it’s been the only way to get fiscal policy done. Remember, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was done through BR when the GOP held the Senate and House.

* The filibuster: until the last few decades, policy was finalized through a simple majority vote in the Senate. The minority could filibuster for days on end to delay and potentially derail majority policy initiatives. This is no more. Now, even the threat of a filibuster means any traditionally-derived policy requires a 60% Senate majority to vote, and not a simple majority. This means little to nothing gets done unless a crisis or BR.

* With the threat of the Dems losing a slim and slimming majority in both houses in 2022 and the timing nature of BR, the time to go big is before 2023.

**What does that mean for markets?**

* So the next budget reconciliation will occur in late September and almost certainly be centered around infrastructure, but the process can start months ahead of then. A bipartisan bill will never see the light of day because of GOP Senate obstructionism, but at least we have a solid timeline for the next fiscal juice. 

* Because of the simple majority nature of budget reconciliation, a very small handful of moderate Dems (Manchin and Sinema primarily) can blow up the whole process, and so we’ve seen the stimulus grand totals wane due to these two Senator’s fiscal responsibility virtue signaling. Markets expect that aspect of in-party fighting to continue and the next undoubtably infrastructure-centered fiscal policy to reflect that trend.

**How could the next BR this year bring surprises?**

* Fiscal stimulus during the pandemic started broad and has narrowed, but this doesn’t mean future fiscal policy will continue to narrow in regards to infrastructure.

* Infrastructure and energy has been ripping during this Biden administration in expectation of infrastructure investment, but prices don’t reflect a BR that wildly defies current lowering political expectations. 

**TLDR: A $2T-$4T infrastructure BR signed off by moderate Dems that lands somewhere in the middle would surprise markets, and unleash a broad bullishness in the latter half of this year in expectation of increased future fiscal policy that’s been recently trending the other direction.**",2021-03-16 08:05:52

DD,PLTR DD - How Apollo will let Palantir take over SaaS in the age of a fractured internet,112,m732kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m732kt/pltr_dd_how_apollo_will_let_palantir_take_over/,34,1616024046.0,"Strap in ~~retards~~ apes, this might be a heftier read than what you crayon-gobbling lot typically do on a regular basis. 

Go to about the 7 minute mark in [this interview of Alex Karp ](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-palantir-ceo-alex-karp/vi-BB19Aen1) where he mentions Apollo:

> We built this product which has gotten very little attention called Apollo. Apollo allows us to maintain and deliver software to any number of clients without essentially growing our Palantir force at all. So we're planning--now that we have Apollo--to grow the number of super cool customers all over the world, and we can do it all without raising headcount.

As he explains it, Apollo allows Palantir to:

> deliver the whole stack in 6 hour [...] We can do this with a small number of people, sitting in our one office that we have, maintaining, updating, and providing them with the product that we build. So they don't have the Frankenstein's monster that takes 2 years to build, and has to be maintained with either human hours--like in gov contract case--or by purchasing new product, or compensating sales people or hiring new IT people that you don't even like talking to. You can actually buy one stack. 

And the last thing he mentions in the interview is a question regarding what happens if the world's internet splits apart into separate jurisdictions due to de-globalization: 

> The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir. 

------

#Apollo

So just what *is* Apollo? For one - [Apollo: Explained](https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-apollo-powering-saas-where-no-saas-has-gone-before-7be3e565c379). The concept is actually pretty simple - here's the dumbed down version:

Most enterprise SaaS companies run on the public cloud and use a single cloud provider. 

Palantir software must run on a multitude of different clouds, including purpose-built government or classified clouds separate from standard public cloud, due to the need of their contracts. 

Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry seamlessly regardless of the type of cloud the end user's data operates on. In other words, Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry onto AWS, Azure, Google, or more unique clouds like CIA Cloud without needing to write individualized code for those deployments. 

Coupled with Palantir's familiarity with working on different unique end-user environments (which they had to do for the army with Gotham), they are essentially running a multi-cloud SaaS instead of a single-cloud SaaS.

As different countries start passing their own regulations on the internet--privacy, data sharing, etc., this will force SaaS companies serving different customers to adapt. 

Meanwhile, Palantir has already prepared for this inevitable outcome by developing Apollo: the continuous delivery system that enables multi-cloud SaaS on whatever cloud infrastructure available to them--public or private. 

**Remember:** Palantir's entire service is helping customers pull their data quickly and effortlessly. 

Boomer companies that acquired hot startups and need to integrate that data will most likely be operating on a multi-cloud environment. Same is true for a US-based internet company operating across the world where privacy and data collection laws may be more stringent.   

----

#Implications

In the Apollo article, it ends with:

>  We run our software in a homogenous way across heterogeneous environments, powered by Apollo. Apollo is the platform that makes it possible to bring a unified SaaS to our entire customer base.

Now pair that up with what Karp said at the end of his interview:

> The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir. 

The world is slowly but surely headed towards different internet blocs, with the EU enacting more stringent data protection laws, China with its Great Firewall, India using the power of periodic internet shutdowns and the push to develop more indigenous software talent, and Russia periodically talking about shutting itself off from the rest of the internet. 

This means multinational firms will eventually be forced to separate out their data in Europe, Japan, and the US. For companies that have already transitioned to the cloud, critical code could be held in entirely different countries and subjected to entirely different sharing laws. 

Palantir's software allows a viewer to *look* at only the pertinent part of the code through Foundry's prioritization of intent as part of its privacy features. But more importantly, Palantir can continue to deliver Foundry even as the laws continuously change and get refined. 

Furthermore, Apollo is also going to drastically cut back on the number of people that Palantir will need to hire to maintain their code. This further cuts down on the biggest cost - employee stock compensation - and allows Palantir to really start growing its profit margins even further on super sticky clients who continues coming back for more.

These last couple days we saw some considerable put interest at the 200 and 300 level. Call to Put ratios were hovering around 45%-50%. (Hence the article on Puts making sum money these last couple days.)

NOW. Today is a whole other story. Bears have gone into hibernation and have CLOSED their puts. Those MF'ers were the ones keeping us down. But today they're scared.

&#x200B;

I'll continue to update you guys. Pretty good sign. The days I have seen a call to put ratio under 60% have been some pretty weak days. We have tons of catalysts this week that can send us to the moon. Keep holding!

Welcome to Wednesday! Happy St. Paddy's Day! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, March 17th, 2021-

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lands-end-crowdstrike-plug-power-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow futures steady as bond yields rise but Nasdaq futures fall

> * Dow futures were steady Wednesday even as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a new 13-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve’s post-meeting release of new economic and interest rate projections and Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference. However, Nasdaq futures slumped about 1%, in step with recent pressure when bond yields rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday broke a seven-session winning streak, retreating from a record high close. The S&P 500 also fell from a record close, breaking five straight days of higher finishes. The Nasdaq bucked Tuesday’s trend and finished higher.

*****

> # 2. Powell needs to tamp down inflation concerns while defending policy

> * As bond yields rise on concerns about inflation, Powell needs to convince traders that easy current Fed monetary policy won’t overheat a recovering economy that just got another Covid stimulus boost. Central bankers get a new batch of housing data to consider at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect February housing starts to drop 2.5% following a 6% decline in January. Building permits for February are seen falling 7% after January’s 10.4% gain. The Fed concludes its two-day March meeting Wednesday afternoon, with no one expecting any change in rates from near zero or any shift in the extraordinary measures designed to support growth during the coronavirus pandemic.

*****

> # 3. 15% of U.S. adults fully vaccinated; Trump touts shots to supporters

> * New daily Covid cases in the U.S., down about 80% from early January, continued to fall as immunity protection increases from vaccinations and high levels of prior infection. More than 15% of the U.S. adult population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, while heading in the right direction, health officials say those vaccination numbers need to go much higher to stomp out the disease, which killed an average of 1,285 people in America over the past seven days, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

> * Former President Donald Trump urged people to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying he would recommend it to “a lot of people that don’t want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me.” However, in a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Trump acknowledged that people were free to decide for themselves whether to get shots.

*****

> # 4. White House sets low bar for Thursday’s U.S.-China meeting

> * The White House is setting low expectations ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan’s first face-to-face meeting with their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. According to a senior Biden administration official, the two sides won’t deliver a joint statement and no major announcements are expected.

> * Reflecting Washington’s concern about the erosion of Hong Kong’s rights, the U.S. sanctioned an additional 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. China said the new sanctions expose America’s “sinister intention to interfere in China’s internal affairs, disrupt Hong Kong and obstruct China’s stability and development.”

*****

> # 5. Uber grants UK drivers worker status after losing labor battle

> * Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers, in the wake of losing a major labor battle there earlier this year. Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers in the U.K. will get some benefits, including a minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions. However, they won’t receive full employee benefits. In a SEC filing, Uber said its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shares of Uber fell more than 2% in U.S. premarket trading.

Hello apes. Before calling me a Cramer cronie or a shill bot - I am in on GME. I like the stock and will not sell until it reaches at least $42069. Obligatory 🚀🚀

Now to the meat: 

Detroit news published an article advising that UWMC ‘missed 80% of their brokers’. Meaning that by the addendum ultimatum on 3/15 they did not reach their target. Nevertheless, here is a breakdown as per the source about how many brokers are on board/declined/have yet to respond.

“The 4,600 brokers who worked with UWM and Rocket or Fairway had until Monday night to agree to an addendum to keep working with UWM. About 3,000 accepted; UWM declined to provide a list of names. Roughly 400 brokers declined the addendum, and another 1,200 have not responded.”

And:

“Not responding doesn’t mean they didn’t commit — we’re still in communication with those who haven’t accepted or some clients are out of town, and it would be a vastly poor assumption to think that all those who have yet to accept won’t accept,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

""We expect about 50% of the undecided will accept, but regardless, out of the 12,000 clients we have, about 85%+ will be all in with UWM.""

Source: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2021/03/16/united-wholesale-mortgage-misses-broker-goal-feud-rocket-mortgage-fairway-independent/4715422001/


TL;DR: 65% of independent brokers are confirmed with signing the deal. 1200 have yet to decide but CEO believe more than 50% will (seems reasonable).

Position: 83 shares @ 8.89av (new to the game, don’t @ me).

Edit: not sure how 1200 have still to make up their mind but a 3/15 addendum date was set. Nevertheless, I’m bullish on UWMC 🚀",2021-03-17 16:33:42

JPOW has to at some point have an adult daddy-daughter conversation with the market and say

‘I’ve supported your degenerate hedonistic lifestyle that has been without personal repercussions, bailed you out for public intoxication and indecent exposure at the country club, now I need you to slowly stand up on your own two feet. You can’t be a trust fund whore your WHOLE life’

Now IF, unlike us, he and the Fed do in fact have a double-digit IQ or above they can create a win-win by

1) being a fake intraday/intraweek🌈 🐻 and use some cleverly bearish words that makes the market shit itself temporarily THE WEEK WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR STIMMYS so that:

2) It provides a great entry point for overextended/hyperinflated stocks that autists are too cautious about entering at PE ratios longer than the fake number my wife gave me for her ‘weekend trip to Cancun with her friends’ - which means people buy the fucking dip and start propping up the market again like a crowdsurfing white girl at a Fleetwood Mac concert.

TL;dr If market shits itself today, it’s not accidental - it’s to provide a great entry point to buy the fucking dip with stimmy $

The FINRA GME SHORT INTEREST report has been issued on MAR-9-2021. The settlement date of the report is FEB-26-2021 and does not include the short selling volume to date of FEB-26-2021.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ny37epynpkn61.jpg?width=1576&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1f8db19dffcc1a7c495f4c5c3252f675eadfa8b

Here we can use the mathematical calculation to calculate the SI of GME.

The FINRA SI of GME is 52.04% by the end of FEB-26-2021.(THIS DATA IS REPORTED BY THE HFs THEMSELVES, THEY WILL SURELY CHEAT AND WILL ONLY BE FINED FOR THAT)

1. The FINRA report is as follows:
2. [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0)

The FINRA report is updated every semimonthly, and the updated data are summarized by FINRA and published in the following 8-9 days.

[http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch)

2. Here comes the calculation

The latest FINRA report shows that the top 10 institutions hold 140.70 M, TOTAL INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP accounting for about 201.73% of the total equity of GME. (LOOK!!! THERE ARE MORE THAN 10 INSTITUTIONS!!! EVEN MAYBE 100 OR 1000)

The GME held by the top 10 funds is about 23.35M, TOTAL FUND HOLDING accounting for 33.48% of the total equity of GME. (AGAIN, MORE THAN 10 FUNDS HOLDING!!!)

As suggested by [desertrock62](https://www.reddit.com/user/desertrock62/), RC Ventures 9M has been repeatedly calculated, here I remove this data.

The total number of these TWO types of shareholdings is : (M is short for million, million)

(140.70 M-26.21M) + (23.35M-9M) = 128.24 M

GME FLOAT SHARES: 69,750,000 , calculated as 70 M ;

GME FREE FLOAT SHARES: 46,920,000 ,calculated as 47M ;

Q: The number of total outstanding shares is only 70 M, so where did these additional 85.05M shares come from?

Synthetic or shadow GME stocks sold by HFs through shorting will be bought by retail investors and bulls, so B who bought the shadow stock and A who lent the stock claimed ownership of the stock at the same time, which will lead to double counting of the same stock.

The total number of shares held MUST BE HIGHER THAN 155.05M, which is calculated on the basis of shorting the same GME stock and selling once (if the same stock is shorted multiple times, the SI will be even higher). The number of stocks that short sellers need at least Short:

128.24M – 70 M = 58.24 M

The Float Short Interest calculation formula of GME is as follows:

Float Short Interest = Short shares / Free float share \* 100%

Bring in data:

Float Short Interest = 58.24 M / 47M \* 100% = 123.91%

This means that at least 1.2 times the number of outstanding shares is needed to close the position.

YOU ARE WELCOME TO POINT OUT ANY MISTAKES THAT I MADE, I AM WILLING TO MAKE ANY EDIT.

EDIT 1: ([desertrock62](https://www.reddit.com/user/desertrock62/))

RC Ventures is Ryan Cohen, new board member and is an insider. Shouldn’t be counted as institution. Possible double count, as the other board members don’t own that much. Mostly Sherman.------------RC Ventures 9M has been removed.

EDIT 2: ([dontkillchris](https://www.reddit.com/user/dontkillchris/))The problem is, if you actually add the number of shares of the top10 institutional owners that are shown there, you don't even get to 100 million shares, and, as somebody else said, some of them are counted twice.--------------The data is automatically added up by FINRA, don't know why it's not consistent but still worth calculating. The other stocks like AM-C don't have such problems.

EDIT 3: I found I can't reply to all of your comments, so I can only edit my post here. Is it because my account is quite new and has certain restriction?

EDIT 4:([bakebakingbaked](https://www.reddit.com/user/bakebakingbaked/)) But also doesn’t take ETFs into consideration-------Yes, maybe not included, so I say it's at least 180% !

EDIT 5:([AlexCormier1144](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexCormier1144/))Hey Zach. Thanks for the DD. Where did you get the 40 M from? How accurate is that number? Depending how accurate it is it could swing the SI by a good margin. Cheers!--------The 40M data is what I got by chance here in Reddit, look at the figure that shows the reddit website, but I lost track of the original post.

EDIT 6: I am in ASIA now, so due to the time difference I will not be able to reply you in time. My calculation just provide you some kind of thoughts. FINRA is the most trustful source as for me. Even FINTEL has been caught cheating in the daily short volume data months ago. Sure I admid my calculation does exist little error, but they will not change the fact that the SI is too too high for the HFs to cover. No matter how to adjust, the real SI should be much much higher than 100%!

EDIT7: Naked Shorting has been changed as ""shorting"".

EDIT8:([Nomadic8893](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nomadic8893/))whats the diff between Finra figures and your figures? why are they showing 50% and you 300%--------------The FINRA SI were reported by the HFs themselves. They can surely cheat, the consequence may only be fined for that cheating. The 300%+ calculation were calculated via the SEC reports of GME long positions, should be much more accurate!

EDIT 9：My account has been ban for commenting (Weired)! Will create another new account TMR!

EDIT10：Position figure removed.

EDIT11: IN ORDER TO DELETE THE REPEATED COUNTED SHARES, I WILL ONLY USE THE INSTITUTIONAL AND FUNDS DATA FOR CALCULATION. AGAIN, THIS ONLY PROVIDES A THOUGHT FOR CALCULATION, THE FINAL SI IS SO DAMMED HIGH!!!

EDIT12: I CAN'T CHANGE THE TITLE, IF POSSIBLE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT AS ""180% SHORT VOLUME"" WHICH IS STILL GOD DAMMED HIGH!!!

EDIT 13: THIS ACCOUNT CAN NO LONGER REPLY THE COMMENTS, FIND ME @[u/ZACK0806cool](https://www.reddit.com/user/ZACK0806cool/) THIS ACCOUNT WILL MAKE FURTHER EDITS AND I WILL TRY TO POST THIS REFINED VERSION THROUGH THAT NEW ACCOUNT!

EDIT 14:Fidelity is listed 3 times. Fidelity m&r co Llc, fidelity m&r, fmr Llc. If FMR close their positions, there might be someone else take over their positions, so I just remain part of the shares. ",2021-03-17 15:26:51

AI operates as a SaaS model where customers subscribe to suite of products for various applications. See some of the industries they serve [https://c3.ai/industries/](https://c3.ai/industries/).

The stock currently trades at near all time low (83$) as of typing this. Trading started back in dec 2020 at 42$ IPO price valuation (Lockup until June 2021) and it did shoot up to 170$+ before the recent dumping along with tech stocks. Company has no debt & plenty of cash 900m+, latest earnings didn't impress wallstreet (19% increase) [https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-Announces-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Results/default.aspx](https://ir.c3.ai/news/news-details/2021/C3-AI-Announces-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Results/default.aspx).

Artificial intelligence industry is massive and expected to grow. The total addressable market for artificial intelligence was a massive $40B in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 42.2% reaching $737.7B by 2027. To put AI in comparison with PLTR, AI currently sits at 8.3B marketcap while PLTR is circa 46.6B.

Recently, AI & Infor formed a partnership: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infor-c3-ai-form-strategic-140000010.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infor-c3-ai-form-strategic-140000010.html) which will expose AI to massive amount of new customers. It is worth to note that current AI customers are few. However, they are huge and every contract is worth millions ex. Baker Hughes. Basically, every new customer at AI brings in massive growth and revenue. I expect this partnership to accelerate AI's revenue and open up for new streams.

Another worth mention point is that AI have also worked with Raytheon on an aircraft readiness program with U.S. Army Aviation, potentially leading the door to other high-profile public sector engagements.

There has been recent insider trade activity which was mainly selling at 85-95$ range which I think provided a very good entry for new traders. Note analysts have this stock as Hold, see some of these analysts targets: Piper Sandler > Overweight 141$ Canaccord Genuity > Hold 120$ Needham & Company > Buy 195$

It is hard to chart a recently traded stock but I believe AI stock is trading at a critical support level in which if breaks will provide unique opportunity to accumulate (IF). It is best to enter this stock with dollar cost average strategy in place so if you end up buying at the current level, make sure to keep some buying power in case we go to the 70s range.

For me, this will be one of the best risk to reward ratio printers if tech stocks reverse back up. You can check TradingView [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AI/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-AI/) and see that your entry will be lesser than most other traders (Most bought in the 90s and 100s range) but please DYOR as usual and only trade what you can afford to lose, best of luck 🚀 🚀 🚀.",2021-03-17 12:37:13

BackgroundIt's space stock trading at a market cap \~$3B with >$1.7B in yearly revenue and $0.3B net profit ,2020 got hit really hard after a series of bad situations which was pretty much the perfect storm: downturn in large satellite contracts, short sell attack, high debt, potential dividend elimination, satellite failure, trouble in liquidating part of business (GEO), transition from Canadian to US based forcing big Canadian holders to sell.

The Stock price crashed from \~$60 to $4, but has since recovered quickly to $45 now, which I think is still undervalued by several factors.

The Company (Maxar Techologies) consists of several branches which joined together in early 2017: Space Systems (manufacturing of Space equipment) , Digitalglobe (Satellite imagery), Radiant (Geospatial analytics), MDA (independent Canadian part of the business: Robotics, Space sensors etc.) and has since been taken over by a new highly competent CEO.

Read here an interview with the CEO Dan Jablonsky about Worldview-Legion, which will be their new constellation of imagery satellites scheduled for launch in early 2021. Right now Capex is high due to this project but this will drive tremendous free cash flow if successful. Margins on their imagery results are 60.5%! [https://spacenews.com/jablonsky-maxar-interview](https://spacenews.com/jablonsky-maxar-interview) ([https://spacenews.com/jablonsky-maxar-interview/)/](https://spacenews.com/jablonsky-maxar-interview/)/)

They received a $375M NASA contract to build part of NASA's Lunar Gateway, this clearly displays NASA's continued support and belief in MAXAR: [http://investor.maxar.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Maxar-Selected-to-Build-Fly-First-Element-of-NASAs-Lunar-Gateway/default.aspx](http://investor.maxar.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Maxar-Selected-to-Build-Fly-First-Element-of-NASAs-Lunar-Gateway/default.aspx)

DD,$UWMC Gamma Squeeze DD,369,m6uhww,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6uhww/uwmc_gamma_squeeze_dd/,85,1615993410.0,"This is not financial advice.

**Edit:** To all you tin foil hat people, I'm not a fucking shill or whatever. I lurk on reddit and work as a software engineer at a FAANG. I just like this shit.

Also, if something in here is stupid, tell me why please I'd like to learn and do the opposite of confirmation bias.

By now we all know what a gamma squeeze is, and generally speaking we know the conditions under which it occurs. This post is intended to very ignorantly explore the degree to which $UWMC might be squozed.

# Hypothetical example:

Take the following example given the following assumptions:

There is only one institution making $UWMC's market

* This market maker only hedges their positions using derivatives of $UWMC and the underlying itself
* The MM is currently delta-neutral

Some Ape decides to buy some calls.

To be delta neutral after selling a call option, a market maker must own a certain number of shares equalling:  **Number of Contracts \* Delta \* 100.**

That is to say, if MM sells 10 OTM calls at time X with a 0.1 delta, they must buy 10 \* .1 \* 100 = 100 shares to be delta-neutral.

If the share price increases over time X + T such that those calls are now deep ITM, **and** the MM is still delta neutral **and** no other options activity took place, somewhere between time X and time T, the market maker must have necessarily purchased 900 additional shares.

It follows then, that the effect a market maker will have on price due to delta hedging is inversely related to the ratio of volume/float. **Simply put,** delta hedging has more of an effect on low-float, lower-liquidity names.

&#x200B;

**OK, where is the ape math for UWMC?**

Here it is:

What if UWMC were to hit $9? A potentially cascading effect:

The $9 and $10 calls would have a delta of \~53, and \~25 respectively, requiring MM's to purchase:

16,765 \* (.53-.34) \* 100 = 318,535 shares to be hedged on the $9's

38,823 \* (.25-.13) \* 100 = 465,875 shares to be hedged on the $10's

.... ect for the rest but I don't want to do the math. The number is bigger than 1M obvs. Someone else can do the math there's probly a tool for it but im hungry af and need to sleep. Multiply this by 3 and thats the MM hedging requirements for the next 3 options expiries. Delta curve its not the same but good enough for ape math. If it starts running it could go for a while, or it might not get enough steam.

Volume has been between average of 7M for the last 10 days, with a public float of 90M.

~~The potential is definitely there.~~ Is this enough for a gamma squeeze soon? IDK someone smarter than me tell me.  I also like UWMC as a mortgage company because of the way they are. Pics below for reference.

DD,Why UWMC is no match for RKT in the long term,0,m6u2km,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6u2km/why_uwmc_is_no_match_for_rkt_in_the_long_term/,28,1615991603.0,"First, I'm not talking about any squeeze potential, which can happen to either/both stocks. I'm interested in the business models of these companies.

**Intro**

I think many people are familiar with the RKT/UWMC feud after the RKT squeeze put both in the spot light. UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers to stop working with other companies, which supposedly 90% of their existing broker partners agreed to. Many people here and on other subreddits are invested, and claiming each of these companies are significantly undervalued. I just want to put things into perspective from the business model side and future outlook side. 

**Business Model - direct lending and broker lending**

First, let's talk about their business models. RKT is fairly diversified a number of lending businesses, with their TPO division for brokers but majority of their mortgage lending business direct to consumer. On the other hand, UWMC only deal with mortgage brokers, who make their cut between the lender and consumer. 

In general, consumers with good credit and who has long standing existing banking relations with a bank or credit union will go there first. They may compare a few lenders to get the best rate, but generally working with lenders directly, especially if they know someone in the business. Only when you have a special circumstance on your credit history/rating or when you can't get a satisfactory loan directly from your local lenders, then your realtor may suggest going to a broker. Brokers make money because they may be able to get you a loan that otherwise you may not (or shouldn't) qualify for. This actually contributed a lot to the mortgage default crisis in 08. 

When I bought my first house I had a special circumstance for my loan application and couldn't get the loan size that I wanted with lenders, and my realtor suggested we can go find brokers who can find high interest rate loans of that size, some of them even from private lenders. Luckily we were able to find a credit union that could work with us. But you get the gist - mortgage brokers sometimes work with (and sometimes prey on) people with low credit who can't loans directly from lenders, and this is what they get paid for. Not all brokers are bad, but there is definitely a ""car salesman"" feeling from them. In the end, I would think the loans that brokers push through are in general more risky than direct to consumer loans. I don't work in the business but people who do could find some statistics. When rates starts to rise, and also after the mortgage moratorium end, the first to default will be these higher interest rate loans from brokers. I think RKT is positioned better than UWMC in a higher interest rate environment.

**Innovation and growth**

This will go hand in hand with the valuation section below. Brokers, no matter what they are brokering, are a thing of the past. With information and technology, the trend is definitely for individuals to browse and pick on their own. This is not to say everything should be automated. Especially for a big purchase like a house, professional help is needed and this is why realtors still have a job even with the rise of Zillow and Redfin etc. But professional help is really only need for getting legal things done and for things that requires tacit skills like negotiating prices on an offer. Mortgage requirements are for the most part set in stone and rates are mostly non-negotiable. So what is the job of the broker? They just aggregate information for you, which technology is poised to do just as well, if not better. Technology also brings transparency so everyone's competing on a level field; you don't need to ""know a guy"" to get your loan at the best rates for your situation. This kind of no frills experience is the new way of doing business and led to the rise of Zillow, Carmax, lemonade, etc. RKT is trying to do that and this is what will transform the mortgage industry, not someone like UWMC, who is just trying to squeeze both the brokers and consumers to get more profits in the short term and stay alive.

**valuation** 

A lot of people are talking of each companies valuations relative to many metrics like sales and earnings. You cannot compare these ratios to the tech and meme growth stocks that we are all so familiar with. Just go to finviz and put in P/S under 4 and see how many companies show up. If a company doesn't have high margins and/or potential for exponential growth, they will not and should not carry a huge P/S ratio. For UWMC, I don't see any way this company can grow very fast or innovate, especially given their hostile attitude towards their own broker partners. For RKT it's harder to say whether their technologies like the mostly automatic underwriting process, and also their attempt to have good UI and customer service, is enough to be deserving of a high valuation. But at least I do see them transforming the traditional mortgage business and I think they stand a high chance of maintaining their rapid growth as more tech-savvy people start to purchase homes.

**Summary**

Don't just buy into UWMC because they spiked later than RKT and they ""seem like an undervalued"" stock. A quick look at the different approaches of these two companies clearly reveals who is the innovative ""sleeping giant"" and who is the boomer stock. While both may be good speculative short term plays, if you are serious long term investor I would take a long and hard at these companies.

Not financial advice, just my 2 cents on these two hot tickers. I'm holding RKT shares and leaps, invested before the spike, sold some profit and hold the rest for medium to long term.",2021-03-17 10:33:23

DD,In a world full of overvalued inflated stocks.....Alibaba is a diamond in a rough,30,m6sv8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6sv8z/in_a_world_full_of_overvalued_inflated/,110,1615986746.0,"Hello fellow autists,

I am presenting an opportunity that has risk but the rewards are much lucrative. Alibaba (BABA) is a severely undervalued tech stock that serves over 1 billion people. **BILLION.** Lately Alibaba has had a barrel of bad news but every analyst and hedge fund on the street agrees on one thing...it is a premier undervalued blue chip tech stock. Nowadays where you fuckers throw 30% OTM calls at all sorts of stuff even though the stock is at 52 week highs. Well I am presenting you a diamond in the rough that also happens to be a mega cap. 

**What is Alibaba?**

 Alibaba Group Holding Limited, also known as Alibaba Group and as Alibaba.com, is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, retail, Internet, and technology. The company provides consumer-to-consumer (C2C), business-to-consumer (B2C), and business-to-business (B2B) sales services via web portals, as well as electronic payment services, shopping search engines and cloud computing services. It owns and operates a diverse portfolio of companies around the world in numerous business sectors. **To summarize it is the Chinese Amazon (AMZN) and does all sorts of things.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Alibaba is a great company with great growth prospects but you don't need me to tell you that just look at the numbers.**

 \-Alibaba’s e-revenue for 2020 was $41.7 billion

\- The latest available info shows that the Alibaba Group held 55.9% of the Chinese ecommerce market

\- In Q3 2020, the percentage of profits that Alibaba generated just from commerce in China was 62%. 

\- Alibaba’s GMV on Singles’ Day in 2020 reached $74.1 billion.

\-**THE PE RATIO IS 24 FOR FUCKS SAKE for a super growth company**

With a five-year annualized  earnings growth rate of 29% and a sales growth rate of 47%, it's hard to find a company with a more impressive track record of growth than Alibaba. It's been a big winner since its IPO in September 2014.

Expectations were high for Alibaba's Singles Day annual shopping event in November, and the company didn't disappoint as sales nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $74 billion.

The company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.

Alibaba's business in China looks a lot like Amazon's in the U.S. Alibaba's **cloud-computing business** is showing solid growth, just like Amazon's booming web services business.

Alibaba also sees dollar signs in food delivery. In 2018, it merged its food delivery service Ele.me with its lifestyle app Koubei to better compete with Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Meituan.

Sales at Alibaba's digital media and entertainment unit are also rising. The unit includes Alibaba's video streaming platform Youku, along with its music streaming service, Xiami. Alibaba also has a licensing agreement with Walt Disney (DIS) unit Buena Vista International, giving it access to a large amount of Disney content.

**Why buy Alibaba right now? They have got butt fucked raw the past few months by the Chinese government? Most recently the Chinese government told Alibaba to dump their media assets.**  

The risk is simple, will the Chinese government continue to make investors uneasy and weigh on Alibaba. They just told them to dump their media assets.... which weirdly enough would be bullish.  An analyst at Morgan Stanley made the case that it would be a positive for Alibaba to do so, as it would improve its margins and provide it with more capital. Their media assets lose them money. The analyst reiterated the firm's overweight rating and $320 price target. **It has only been negative news lately and you must buy when others are fearful.** 

I am a capitalist loving spitfuck, I am no commie. If you want capitalism to thrive throw some money into this strong fundamental company.

**What is the play and why now?**

**May 21 240 Calls** 

The stock has gotten wrecked and has showed stabilization. This is a great opportunity to enter in and ride it to tendie town. Worst case scenario it breaks 220 support and you eat the losses. Best case scenario it skyrockets leading up to earnings in May and you cash out for great gains. It will by no means be an easy diamond hands. This stock moves very crazily, I am currently down 9% on my calls. But when IV picks back up and it skyrockets we will be driving lambos. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

On my etrade research all the analysts have price targets of 285+, average target of 325, and highest being 395. And those guys get paid a lot more than I do to do research.

Cannot go tits up.

Yeah, I have a newer account, fuck off about it.
This was done at 11Am, March 16th.

TLDR: AMC is showing signs of a reversal right out of open/premarket. Almost all MACD time charts support this, and so does RSI. 

GME is set for a red day. Yeah I know, I expected to be in a better spot, but unfortunately I'd expect more of a sell off most of tomorrow, we are seeing constant manipulation of Hedges painting the tape on stocks, bouncing sales back and forth at a volume of 60,61,62, shares etc. Whatever it is, go look at the order book most days, its completely obvious. We SHOULD have finally gotten  into an uptrend on March 16, but because of this we didn't. Unfortunately the MACD is poised for us to have another possibly bad run all of tomorrow and possible untill Friday. 

My opinion: I expect an abnormality to occur at some point. This isn't normal trading, we SHOULDN'T  be trading sideways like this, it isn't healthy or natural. I think similar to ENDGAME Dd, we will see a completely unpredictable abnormality between March 17th and 19. 

What we need to do: LOOK AT THE FUCKING MACD
LOOK AT THE FUCKING ORDER BOOK. 
You fucking apes want this shit to happen? Stop watching guys on YouTube not even displaying the information that matters, you NEED to learn how, and when to act on this reversal or your just going to fuck everyone. Whoever the good hedge is, or the whale, who is fighting for us, will act at some point, and it will be obvious to anyone watching MACD and order books.

Hello, fellow retards and autists.  I need to borrow your diligent, Aspergers level analytics ability and earth-shatteringly, retarded reasoning to pile drive my portfolio into the red.  I can't believe I'm actually coming here for advice.  Please see the ""case study"" below.

I'm a huge fan of Dr. Michael Burry and how he manages Scion Asset Management, LLC. The guy does his due-diligence and thinks about his investment opportunities from an outside perspective. If the numbers and story pencil, he will bet against anyone and doesn't let the court of public opinion cloud his judgment.

I'm inquiring about the recent Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) $LUMN trade.

Based on my research, Scion Asset Management acquired 1.15M shares of $LUMN at an average value of $9.74 per share. This trade accounts for approx. 8.02% of Scion's portfolio. If we're looking at Burry's past investments, he's usually one of the first players to the table including both $GME (#diamond hands) and shorting the housing market. 

Lumen has not only rebranded their name and marketing efforts, but their entire business strategy moving forward by selling B2B data and fiber optic services since many customers are moving away from phone lines/services: (direct quotes from my research)...

1. ""**Lumen** is a measure of the brightness of light, and the company’s competitive advantage this century has come from its massive fiber network, stretching 450,000 route miles. That has helped CenturyLink survive even as consumers cut their home phone lines in favor of wireless providers and switched off DSL in favor of faster alternatives. But transporting light signals can also be a commodity service. Lumen is now pushing to offer more higher-value applications and enterprise services directly to its customers, reflected in the company’s new motto: “**The Platform for Amazing Things**.”
2. ""Lumen, which was primarily an ISP/Phone company, stepped up their B2B and backbone connectivity to major Internet companies which the purchase of Level3. They'll be key to serving as the fiber backbone for 5G.""

Earlier today, I submitted a limit buy order for $LUMN @ $14.00 which won't be executed until tomorrow when the market opens. I don't believe this trade will turn a real profit for 1-2 years as turning a battleship of this size takes a significant amount of time and resources. But looking at the story and fundamentals, the strategy is sound. Outside the rebranding and change of strategy, Lumen is using some of the newly minted capital to paydown, high interest, debt.

Am I too late on this trade or too retarded to function?  Good or bad, let me hear it.",2021-03-17 08:44:00

It’s been such a crazy last couple of months and I honestly haven’t had this much (internet) excitement in my life. 

This is the very first and only stock that I’ve ever purchased and although I don’t know shit about stocks (I understand the concept but that’s it), this is something I’ll never forget. I’m happy for everyone who’s lives have changed for the better and it’s heart warming to see the good that this place does as far as charity. 

But I’m gonna be a negative Nancy ape for a bit. You guys saw it. You guys are seeing it. We’re all watching it live. How manipulative media outlets are. How quick they are at shooting their arrows. How our government basically just gave us an amateur horse and pony show when they “questioned” that Bosnian whatever the fuck from Robindahood. They tried to grill our boy DFV more than any of them. It really pissed me off watching that. 

They tried throwing attention away from GME (silver anyone? lol). They tried attacking this place. They tried attacking day traders. They tried attacking DFV. They tried every single thing they could and failed. I truly believe it’s because of the good intent in this sub that helped. That and you guys are seriously stupid as fuck. 

I mean, I know the cliche of “never trust the news,etc” but to be watching it live is just....I mean fuck. If you can’t see it by now you’re obviously on the other side. Not only is no one going to be held accountable, more than likely they’ll just change up the rules to punish the “little guys”. It really shows us whose best interest our government and media favor. 

You honestly couldn’t write a better scenario on exposing these slime balls. A fucking store that buys and sells used video games. A dude that seems like he’d make Keanu Reeves look like an asshole and goes by the name Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepFuckingValue on Reddit exposed them; but not because he wanted to fuck them over, but because he saw the value in it and liked the stock lol.

I can’t sleep as I am preparing to go on nights, so I spent some time on FINRA’s website looking at short volumes because bears suck and I found $CSTL 

I have no position in $CSTL and I don’t plan to take one. 
$CSTL has a 1.6bn mktcp and little to no option interest and what interest there is all puts and those bears are going get fucked here. 

WTF is $SCTL
Castle Biosciences makes melanoma tests, and is using AI and genetic profiles to make predictive outcomes on melanoma cancer. 

In December CSTL got partial medicare approval for their most advanced Melanoma screening, on the LCD level. To you people who know nothing about biotechs, let me school you why this is huge. FDA approval is great, but if CMS (admin for Medicare and Medicaid) won’t pay for whatever widget the biotech is hawking than the company is going out of business. LCD approval means with a geographical area, the test is paid for. For CSTL that area represents 90% of the melanoma diagnoses in the US.

tl;dr CSTL is going to get PAID when hot girl summer starts and my wife and her boyfriend start fucking outside. 

Let’s talk pipeline, IE what have you done from me lately. CSTL is growing their testing portfolio from 2bn TAM to 5bn. They clearly are not planning on being a one-hit wonder looking for a buyout. 

Okay we know what the do and that they are going to get paid for it. Lets DD on their financials. 

This past year they retired all of their debt, ALL OF THEIR DEBT, and they quadruped their Cash on hand from 100mm to 400mm. No debt, tons of cash, test getting CMS payment approval, growth to the moon baby. 

Versus other biotech test companies, they have higher revenue growth and a higher profit margin. 
ROE, ROI, ROA all meet or exceed the industry. 

Let’s look at the negatives, their latest results showed a -.24 v estimate of -.12. No surprise there people were staying inside due to COVID and retiring all of their debt. With only 84% institutional ownership it shows skepticism for future growth, but the vaccine is here and people will be going outside. PT on the stock is 90.00 and it exceeded that back in march. Currently in 60’s there is a ton of room for growth. RSI is right at 50, so even more room to grow.",2021-03-17 08:27:24
